Meeting with Custom Panel: I asked what we're the quantities and Octavio interjected to reiterate that we need to understand the business opportunity and determine if this is something right for us to get into. However, at the same time I understand that the customer is looking to find out if we're willing to work with them and using our expertise to find out if their application is even feasible. So I viewed this as a engineering focused meeting but the advice here is to always circle back to the business side of things and show that I'm asking the right questions and firmly requesting answers.
Pratt & Whitney motor and stator opportunity
Iris feedback was that she was testing me. She asked me to review the documentation sent by the customer and determine whether we should pursue it our not.
What I did was come up with a list of questions I should ask to make this determination. It did not include enough technical questions only business related. Iris's focus was on technical questions. 
What product have we created that is most similar to this new opportunity?
It was established that our product built for NASA is most similar. But with key differences.
The new opportunity is for higher RPM 96000 vs 60000, they're about the same size, higher power 2.4KW vs 600 W
I need to know the relationship between kVA and W. I do but couldn't remember the equation when needed. 
She asked about the drawings there was a subtle change in one of the dimensions regarding the drawings for the stator from one to the other. She asked why is that?
She's concerned about the schedule. I should know how long it takes us to go from design to prototype. However, this is something she had to look up.
I suggested asking the staff engineer. Her advice is for me to use him for high level motor/stator work but to ask the Mechanical Engineering Manager or the Power Electronics Manager for help reviewing the specifications.

Think from complete system perspective
Defense is 60% of our revenue
HESC 25% of our revenue Know operating hours and how many we have on ships. Keep up-to-date with this program.
Focus on Market Research $2-3 Mil is needed to complete the DC1000 development. Create a plan on how to secure that amount and convince the CEO to give us that much but need to win business to justify that.
Figure out how many tactical vehicles are being produced what  market share can we capture. Stay up-to-date on government funding and how much is being allocated to these programs that we have a chance at.
Create a plan of action for AUSA starter gen, alternators and turbo generators, hybrid power.
Iris believes I am an introvert who has no problem talking to people but at my own discretion.
She says I don't get my energy from others.
I'm a slow decision maker or make decisions slower than her. Something she doesn't see as a bad thing because there are times she agrees that things should be more thought out and evaluated.
Market Research feedback I need to elaborate more on the information I'm presenting. Don't always assume the individual knows what I'm talking about and just get in the habit of over-explaining for clarity.
We are both captains on our personality assessments.

We had the opportunity to tour their relatively new facility. They have quite the capabilities especially testing capabilities including dual use EMI chamber and Shock and vibration tables. We learned from our contact the Director of Business Development Carlos Aguirre, they submitted for Track 1 and 2 of the DIU solicitation. 
 
ePEEK DIU - We were not awarded this opportunity. However, like I mentioned earlier we've learned that DRS has also submitted for track 2. I believe we're building a good relationship with DRS and our plan is to leverage this knowledge and prepare ourselves to potentially support should they be selected.
 
SBIR Lightweight Submission - We submitted our proposal for the Lighter, Low-Cost Family of Bidirectional Inverter topic. I think collectively we believe this is one of our best SBIR proposals yet in regards to our inverter technology. Arash came up with a new topology for the internal design of our inverter. For this proposal we went with an Interleaved topology which means the switching signals of the phases are time shifted, reducing the overall ripple amplitude. And reduced ripple allows for a lower inductance value. So essentially we were able to dramatically decreased the size of the inductor. Which reduced the overall weight. Ryan also did a great job packaging this new design and using creative techniques to also lightweight the system. Overall we are very confident in this proposal.
 
DRS Naval Power Systems has been producing a generator in-house for the Land Electronics business and is looking to

Bloomberg's Taxonomy Questions
Monday, December 16, 2024
1:59 PM
 
Here are ten Level 5 Bloomberg taxonomy questions on ground vehicle export power, focusing on advanced knowledge, integration, standards, and optimization.
 
        1.        What are the primary challenges in ensuring interoperability of ground vehicle export power systems with different tactical microgrid standards, and how can these challenges be mitigated? Challenges include integrating the microgrid itself. There's a higher level of complexity when creating export power systems that comply with TMS do the firmware necessary for it to work properly. Depending on the voltage output requirements, a system with standard/low voltage output may meet size and weight requirements for a vehicle and grid but it the grid uses a foreign/higher voltage output in order to meet that requirement the overall system's size and weight may change. This may no longer fit the vehicle's size and weight constraints.
        2.        How does the integration of high-voltage DC and AC export power capabilities impact vehicle design constraints, and what modifications are necessary to accommodate these capabilities? Higher DC voltage applications usually comes with a requirement to galvanically isolate the dc source from the ac output. In cases like this a DC/DC Converter is used. A DC/DC can be used to step up or down the DC source to provide a constant AC output. It also can be used to generate a fourth leg for a neutral wire.
        3.        Describe the role of bidirectional power flow in modern military ground vehicles and its impact on the efficiency and functionality of export power systems. Bidirectional flow in military ground vehicles consist of DC to AC power stemming from a battery source to a bidirectional inverter which then outputs AC voltage at a specified voltage level (i.e. 208VAC). This will then power onboard or offboard electronics and/or systems or even return power to the grid. For AC to DC the inverter will accept power from an AC source (i.e. grid) convert it to DC and output DC power which can recharge a battery.
        4.        What are the latest advancements in inverter technology for ground vehicle export power, and how do these improvements enhance energy resilience in the field? The latest advancements are focused on thermal management and use of Silicon Carbide devices.
        5.        How do environmental and operational stressors (such as temperature extremes, dust, and humidity) affect the reliability and performance of ground vehicle export power systems, and what design features help mitigate these effects? These factors affect the export power systems greatly. It affects the size and weight of the system. Temperature alone is a driving factor in the size and weight due to a few factors:
Does the system need to be air cooled or liquid cooled?
Does it need coolant incorporated within the system or will it be provided externally.
        6.        Explain the regulatory and safety considerations that must be addressed when exporting power from military ground vehicles to support external loads, particularly in NATO-compliant environments.
        7.        What are the advantages and trade-offs of using silicon carbide (SiC) vs. gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors in ground vehicle power export inverters? Gallium has been regularly used in aerospace applications. It is said to be more expensive than SiC and requires more testing at high voltage levels. If we as a company switch from SiC to GaN then it will set us back to a TRL 2 and would require years of quality testing and evaluations. 
        8.        Discuss how energy storage systems can be effectively integrated with ground vehicle export power systems to provide continuous power support for critical external loads.
        9.        What are the key considerations in implementing a modular power export architecture for ground vehicles, and how can this architecture support scalability and future power demands?
        10.        How can machine learning and predictive analytics be applied to optimize ground vehicle export power management, and what benefits do these technologies offer in dynamic tactical environments?

Even after an award, progress can stall due to shifting budget priorities or administrative red tape, tying up resources that might otherwise be deployed on faster-moving commercial opportunities.
Resource-Intensive Bids:
Compiling RFP responses for defense organizations is notoriously time-consuming and expensive. It may require specialized legal, engineering, and project management expertise to meet stringent documentation and testing requirements.
Small to mid-sized companies can find themselves outpaced by large defense primes that can weather long periods before seeing a return on investment.
Why It's a Concern:
Time and money spent on lengthy defense acquisition processes could be put toward faster-turnaround, higher-margin projects in commercial or industrial sectors, leading to better near-term returns.
 
2. Uncertain and Politically Dependent Budgets
Budget Volatility:
Defense budgets are heavily influenced by political cycles. A change in administration, shifting defense priorities (e.g., pivot from ground combat systems to cybersecurity), or macroeconomic pressures can reduce funding for certain programs.
Delayed or canceled projects can leave companies with sunk R&D costs and no viable market for their product.
Strategic Shifts and Policy Constraints:
Military export rules vary widely by country, and changes in foreign policy or export regulations (e.g., ITAR restrictions in the U.S.) can instantly close off markets or impose onerous compliance burdens.
The risk of sudden embargoes or sanctions may further limit sales opportunities or require costly modifications to product specifications.
Why It's a Concern:
Heavy reliance on defense exports leaves a company vulnerable to political whims, defense spending re-allocations, and international policy shifts. Consistent revenue streams are far from guaranteed.
 
3. Intense Competition from Large Defense Primes
Established Giants:
Industry heavyweights such as Raytheon, BAE Systems, or Lockheed Martin have extensive relationships, proven track records, and large sales teams dedicated to capturing defense contracts.
Small entrants face the uphill task of proving their technology is not only innovative but also reliable at scale and robust enough for combat environments.
Limited Room for Mid-Tier Players:
Defense agencies often prefer to work with a small number of established prime contractors to manage risk. Subcontracts may trickle down, but margin pressures can be severe.
Gaining prime contractor status can be next to impossible without the financial cushion, branding, and existing supply chain relationships that large, entrenched companies hold.
Why It's a Concern:
Winning significant market share requires overcoming deep-seated supplier relationships and well-funded competition. A small or newly entering company could deplete resources in the process.
 
4. High R&D Costs and Specialized Requirements
Stringent Performance & Environmental Standards:
Military specifications (e.g., MIL-STD-810, MIL-STD-1275) demand extensive testing for shock, vibration, temperature extremes, and EMI/EMC compliance.
Achieving these certifications can add substantial overhead, from custom materials to specialized design procedures.
Niche Customizations:
Each program may require bespoke solutions (unique output power, form factors, or communications interfaces). This reduces economies of scale and inflates per-unit costs.
Ongoing engineering redesigns, specialized documentation, and iterative qualification testing divert resources from more scalable commercial product lines.
Why It's a Concern:
The specialized nature of military components and the need for heavy testing/certification significantly raise development costs, reducing the potential profitability—especially for low production volumes.
 
5. Limited and Fragmented International Markets
Export Control and Licensing:
The international military export landscape is heavily controlled. Companies must navigate export licenses, ITAR/EAR regulations, and individual country import laws.
Each region may have differing standards and interoperability requirements, compounding engineering complexity.
Regional Political Instability:
Defense deals are often embroiled in geopolitical issues. In some regions, partnerships with certain nations could alienate other potential customers.
Political or diplomatic disputes can stall or terminate deals that seemed promising—leaving extensive sunk costs without recourse.
Why It's a Concern:
Global expansion for military exports is far from straightforward. Even “secured” deals can be voided by changes in regulations or political tensions, amplifying the risk of relying on these markets.
 
6. Reputation and Ethical Considerations
Brand Perception:
Involvement in defense markets may conflict with some investors' or customers' ethical stances. This might limit access to certain funding sources or commercial partners that avoid the defense sector.
Negative publicity around arms exports or controversies in foreign militaries can spill over onto suppliers.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):
Companies focusing on sustainability and green technologies might find the defense market at odds with their public commitments, risking brand dilution or stakeholder pushback.
Why It's a Concern:
Potential brand risks and ethical disputes may deter talent, investors, or commercial customers, limiting future growth beyond defense.
 
7. Opportunity Cost vs. Other Markets
Faster-Growing, Less Regulated Sectors:
Commercial and industrial power solutions (e.g., data centers, renewable energy farms, electric vehicle infrastructure) may offer better margins, lower barriers to entry, and more predictable sales cycles.
Consumer electronics, industrial automation, or medical devices can absorb technology transfers from advanced power electronics without the heavy compliance burdens.
Competitive Differentiation in Commercial Markets:
A product's “unique selling points”—like high power density or advanced wide-bandgap semiconductors—could be more easily monetized in sectors prioritizing throughput, green energy, or digitization.
Less red tape means an easier path to scaling.
Why It's a Concern:
Redirecting resources to commercial or industrial power segments may yield quicker returns, larger potential volumes, and fewer regulatory headaches, ultimately boosting the company's bottom line faster.
 
Final Verdict: The Case Against Pursuing Military Export Power
When weighing the high cost of entry, lengthy procurement cycles, intense competition, and budgetary uncertainties, the military export power market appears less appealing. Ethical considerations and brand implications further complicate matters, and opportunity costs could be substantial—investing in more agile, rapidly evolving commercial or industrial power sectors might deliver better returns with fewer constraints.
In conclusion, while the defense export power market can offer some high-profile wins and potentially large contract values, the combined challenges—ranging from politics and regulations to specialized requirements and stiff competition—suggest that this path is fraught with risks and operational hurdles. A company may be better served channeling its engineering innovation and resources into markets with simpler regulations, broader customer bases, and faster revenue cycles.
 
High Concern
Lengthy Procurement Cycles and Bureaucracy
Rationale: Long approval processes tie up resources and delay revenue.
Uncertainty and Politically Dependent Budgets
Rationale: Changes in political leadership and defense priorities can dramatically shift or reduce funding and contract opportunities.
Fierce Competition from Large Defense Primes

Micro
 
Below is a two-part response:
A Methodology for finding out which vehicle platforms are undergoing incremental changes that might drive new or upgraded export power requirements.
An Example of “drilling down” into specific platforms and opportunities based on known or likely modernization steps.
 
1. Methodology: How to Identify Niche Opportunities
A. Tap into Official DoD and OEM Sources
Program Executive Office (PEO) Roadmaps
Look for updates from the Army (e.g., PEO Ground Combat Systems, PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support) and the Marine Corps (e.g., Program Executive Officer Land Systems).
These offices publish modernization plans and annual or semiannual roadmaps outlining which vehicle platforms are slated for upgrades (e.g., 28V to 48V electrical systems, adding battery packs, installing new sensor suites).
Requests for Information (RFIs) and RFPs
Regularly check SAM.gov (in the U.S.) or equivalent procurement portals.
RFIs often hint at changes in existing platforms or new requirements (e.g., “seeking advanced high-voltage inverters for ground vehicles”).
OEM Press Releases & Investor Presentations
Companies such as BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Oshkosh Defense, Leonardo DRS periodically discuss upcoming vehicle refreshes or electrification plans.
Investor calls and earnings releases sometimes reveal details about next-gen or incremental upgrades.
B. Leverage Industry Events & Associations
Defense-Focused Conferences
AUSA, NDIA, GVSETS (Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering & Technology Symposium): Listen to OEM or Army presentations. They often highlight incremental design changes.
SOFIC (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference): Sometimes specialized vehicles get incremental changes for silent watch or export power.
National Advanced Mobility Consortium (NAMC)
NAMC members collaborate on ground vehicle technology. Workshops or member briefings can reveal which platforms are transitioning from older voltage architectures or integrating new battery packs.
C. Conduct Direct Interviews & Networking
Prime Contractors & Tier 1 Suppliers
Reach out to engineering teams at prime contractors. They usually know the biggest pain points or upcoming upgrades in detail.
Ask about new sensor installations, directed-energy add-ons, or advanced communications that drive higher power demand.
Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC)
Engage with subject matter experts at GVSC. They frequently publish articles or white papers detailing incremental changes like 28V to 48V transitions and how that might affect onboard power requirements.
D. Review Technical Specifications & Manuals
Vehicle Technical Manuals 
Often contain references to allowable voltage ranges, expansion ports, or power margins. A new version of the manual might highlight an extra 5-10 kW demand for upcoming sensor kits.
Testing & Evaluation Reports 
Government test agencies (e.g., Aberdeen Test Center) sometimes release summary findings on vehicles undergoing prototype evaluations, which may note changes to onboard power.
 
2. An Example: Drilling Down into Specific Platforms
Below is a hypothetical but realistic scenario showing how small changes in a vehicle's design could create an inverter sales opportunity.
Scenario: Upgrading a Medium Tactical Vehicle from 28V to 48V
Vehicle Platform Identified:
U.S. Army's Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV). The Army announces a plan to transition from a standard 28V DC architecture to a 48V or even higher-voltage bus for future electronics and hybrid capabilities.
Incremental Power Demand Changes:
Added Sensor Suites: The next-gen FMTV might need advanced situational awareness sensors (e.g., thermal cameras, LiDAR). These electronics require an additional 5-10 kW of clean, stable power.
Battery Packs Integration: A new lithium-ion battery pack is introduced for silent watch operations—requiring a specialized, bidirectional DC/DC converter or inverter to manage the recharge cycles.
Opportunity for Export Power Inverter:
Because the vehicle can generate surplus power for external loads (e.g., field hospitals, radar setups), the Army wants an onboard inverter that can handle higher voltage and increased power demands.
A 28V → 48V upgrade might necessitate a new form factor, advanced cooling solutions, and robust EMI filtering—all of which can't be met by the old system.
Sales Angle & Product Fit:
Value Proposition: A modular, high-efficiency inverter designed specifically for 48V operation. Emphasize ease of integration, minimal wiring changes, and the ability to handle transient loads.
Key Contacts: PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support (CS&CSS), Army Contracting Command, plus prime integrators like Oshkosh Defense or BAE Systems if they handle FMTV modernization.
Evidence & Feasibility:
Government briefings or RFI documents mention “incremental vehicle architecture changes” to support advanced electronics, confirming the Army's plan to eventually shift voltage levels.
Testing data from smaller pilot programs (e.g., SBIR Phase II on vehicle electrification) indicates the old 28V system is near capacity, reinforcing the need for new inverters.
 
Key Takeaways
Look for Clues:
Dig into defense program offices, OEM announcements, and vehicle specifications to catch early signals of incremental design changes—like voltage shifts or new battery packs.
Target the ‘Micro' Opportunity:
Pinpoint exactly which modules or system expansions (additional sensors, communication suites, directed-energy weapons) are driving new power requirements.
Validate Demand:
Confirm the budget, timeline, and official interest through RFPs, high-level roadmaps, or direct discussions with program managers.
Highlight Differentiators:
Show how your inverter or power electronics solution uniquely meets the specialized form factor, thermal, and EMI/EMC constraints introduced by these incremental changes.
By following these steps—studying official sources, networking with defense stakeholders, and monitoring technical changes—you can drill down into the exact vehicle platforms and minor design updates that open the door to new export power opportunities for inverters or other power electronics.

        •        Key Benefit: Reduced fuel usage, quieter operation, and lower emissions, ideal for forward bases or mobile command centers.
        5.        Next-Gen Inverters
        •        Role: Convert DC power (from batteries, vehicle alternators, solar arrays) to AC or vice versa, enabling flexible operation of equipment and electrified subsystems.
        •        Key Benefit: High efficiency, reduced size and weight (SWaP), and robust operation in harsh environments.
 
(A helpful graphic might show these five systems branching off from a central “Tactical Energy” node.)
 
5. Integrating the Pieces: Where Do Inverters Fit?
        1.        Enabling Hybridization
        •        Inverters sit at the heart of hybrid systems, managing power flow between engines, batteries, and loads.
        •        Advanced control algorithms allow for smooth, bidirectional energy exchange.
        2.        Vehicle Electrification
        •        In vehicle-mounted solutions, inverters convert high-voltage DC (from battery packs or alternator outputs) to drive AC loads (radars, comms) or feed into export power connectors.
        •        They also enable vehicle systems to pull power from external sources (e.g., microgrids, solar panels).
        3.        Microgrids & Field Deployments
        •        Rapidly-deployable microgrids rely on inverters to synchronize multiple power sources and maintain stable voltage/frequency.
        •        High-efficiency inverters reduce total generator runtime, saving fuel and lowering heat signature.
        4.        Fulfilling the Government's Operational Energy Goals
        •        Fuel Efficiency: Fewer gallons of fuel burned per mission.
        •        Reliability & Resilience: Redundancy through hybrid solutions that keep mission-critical systems powered.
        •        Future Scalability: As demands for higher power (e.g., directed energy, sensor fusion) grow, next-gen inverters scale easily, integrating with new battery chemistries or renewable inputs.
 
(A simple block diagram might show Inverters linking “Vehicle Power,” “Battery Storage,” and “Generators,” feeding into “Military Loads” and “Export Power.”)
 
6. Conclusion: The Story of Operational Energy
        •        Tactical, Prime, and Utility energy concepts form the backbone of the government's push for resilient, efficient, and modern power.
        •        Tactical Energy is increasingly reliant on hybridization, electrification, and next-gen power electronics to remain agile in contested environments.

Introduction 
History with Octavio
Background on Opportunity Who is Honeywell working with NASA?
Comparison with existing product to Problem statement
Potentially avoid NRE or redesign of part
 
Can she get a blanket ROM for existing blower
She went on usa spending found the contract we have with NASA she is curious if that is similar to what we would charge Honeywell 
She mentioned it stated 361 need to double check the website to confirm Calnetix contract with NASA for the CO2 scrubber blower on the ISS
Honesty from her: she's exploring budgeting and would prefer to avoid NRE
 
I hope you are well! We have spoken in the past about a blower for the Carbon Dioxide Removal by Ionic Liquid System (CDRILS) Flight Demonstration Unit (FDU). Since we last spoke, our problem statement has changed a bit, and I was wondering if have anything to fit our updated problem statement below. If it fits our updated problem statement, could you please send a ROM and datasheet for the FBCO2 blower? If you do not have something, could you send a ROM to meet our problem statement? 
 
I wanted to give you a quick update on a recent customer inquiry regarding a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for one of our existing blower units. The customer specifically asked for an ROM estimate and mentioned that they'd like to align the terms with the conditions we had in our previous NASA contract.
They're also pretty focused on avoiding Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs, as it fits better with their current budget constraints. With that in mind, they're actively planning their budget and have made it clear that they'd prefer to keep any additional NRE expenses off the table for this request.
Please keep this in mind as we work on their estimate. Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions as we move forward—I'd love to hear your input.
 
Did not do full analysis on acustics 
We are not allowed to run at full speed due to limited current the dc bus only allowed 111 volts not 128? For the controller and due to the noise issue we do not meet the noise requirements at higher frequencies
Suggest to get a least 2 pricing at one but more expensive
 
 
Based on our current assessment, the estimated cost for one unit is approximately $400,000.
In order to help minimize supplier-related expenses and ensure the most cost-effective approach, we advise a minimum order of two units. This will allow us to consolidate certain costs and potentially secure more favorable terms from our suppliers.
Additionally, could you please let us know your anticipated timeline or when you expect to issue a formal RFQ? Having a clearer picture of your schedule will help us align our resources and expedite the process on our end.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the details further. I look forward to your feedback and appreciate the opportunity to support your needs.

Custom Panel - Hydro Electric Generator
Tuesday, January 7, 2025
8:24AM
The project involves developing a brushless DC permanent magnet (PM) generator/motor with a thin-gap motor design and an integrated turbine, requiring careful balance and airflow considerations. The impeller design is handled externally, but its specifications (diameter, blade count, material) are crucial for analysis. The initial power output target is 5-10 kW, but voltage and frequency requirements need clarification. Power conversion will utilize a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) in generating mode, but the grid connection approach needs to be defined—whether fully grid-tied or wired to a panel. More details are required on power quality, voltage regulation, and harmonics.
 
Production planning requires a clearer estimate of quantity needed (“not 1-2 but quite a few”), and while UL compliance is desired, the specific standards must be identified. The enclosure will be a cement vault for easy transport, with size and weight constraints considered. An existing 35kW unit (C-75) is available, but its relationship to the new design must be clarified.
 
From a business perspective, assessing market demand, customization potential, and non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs is essential. A pricing model needs to balance materials, manufacturing, and profit margins. The next steps include clarifying grid requirements, gathering turbine specs, defining power output characteristics, determining applicable UL standards, estimating production quantities, and conducting a cost and market analysis. Addressing these factors will pave the way for a successful turbine-generator system.
 
 
1.  Generator/Motor System
 * Type: Brushless DC Permanent Magnet (PM) generator/motor
 * Motor Design: "Thin gap" motors (need more info on this - what specific type?)
 * Turbine Integration:  Turbine will be mounted inside the motor (Interesting!  Requires careful design for balance and airflow)
 * Impeller Design:  Someone else is responsible, but you NEED their specs (diameter, blade count, material, etc.) to proceed with your design and analysis.
 * Power Output:  Initial target is 5-10 kW.  What is the desired voltage and frequency output of the generator?
2.  Power Conversion and Grid Connection
 * VFD Operation:  Using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) in generating mode to convert the variable DC output from the generator to AC.
 * Grid Connection: "Push it back" to the grid implies grid-tied, but you later state "Not grid tie just wired to a panel."  Need clarification!
   * If grid-tied, what are the interconnection requirements and regulations?
   * If not grid-tied, what is the purpose of the panel? What loads will it serve?
 * Power Characteristics:  Need more information on the desired power quality (voltage regulation, harmonic distortion, etc.).  A questionnaire is a good idea to gather these details.
3.  Project Requirements
 * Quantity: "Not 1-2 but quite a few" -  Need a more specific estimate for production planning and cost estimation.
 * Safety and Compliance: UL compliance is desired, but not necessarily certification.  What specific UL standards are relevant to this type of system?
 * Enclosure:  Cement vault for easy shipping and protection.  Consider size and weight limitations for transportation.
 * Existing Unit: You have a 35kW unit (C-75) available. How does this relate to the new design? Is it a prototype or a different model?
4.  Business Opportunity
 * Market Analysis:  Need to assess the market potential for this type of turbine-generator system, considering the specific application, customization options, and NRE costs.
 * Pricing and Profitability:  Develop a pricing model that accounts for the cost of materials, manufacturing, customization, and NRE, while ensuring a reasonable profit margin.
Key Questions and Next Steps
 * Clarify grid connection requirements.
 * Gather detailed turbine impeller specifications.
 * Define power output characteristics and quality requirements.
 * Determine the specific UL standards that apply.
 * Estimate the quantity needed and potential market size.
 * Develop a detailed design and cost analysis.
 * Assess the business opportunity and pricing strategy.
By addressing these points, you'll be well on your way to developing a successful and innovative turbine-generator system. Good luck!

 1. Mechanical Energy Generation
- Hydroelectric Turbine: Water flows through the turbine, causing it to spin. The turbine converts the kinetic energy of flowing water into rotational mechanical energy.
- Coupling with the Motor: The turbine is mechanically connected to the shaft of the brushless permanent magnet motor. As the turbine spins, it drives the motor.
 2. Electrical Energy Generation
- Brushless Permanent Magnet Motor:
  - This motor acts as a generator in this setup.
  - As the turbine spins the motor, its permanent magnets and windings generate alternating current (AC) electricity.
- The motor is designed to produce high-frequency (1600Hz) and high-voltage (400V) AC power.
 3. Power Conversion Using a VFD
The raw electrical output from the motor (1600Hz, 400V) is not directly usable for most applications. This is where the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) or inverter comes in.
 
 Step 1: Rectification (AC to DC)
- The VFD first converts the high-frequency AC output from the motor into direct current (DC) using a rectifier circuit.
- This step smooths out the variable frequency and voltage generated by the motor, creating a stable DC power source.
 
 Step 2: DC to AC Conversion
- The VFD then converts the DC power back into AC at the desired frequency and voltage using an inverter circuit.
- The inverter uses advanced electronics to "chop" the DC signal into an AC waveform at precise frequencies and voltages.
 
 Step 3: Output Configuration
- The VFD can be programmed to produce two different output configurations:
  - 60Hz, 110/120V Single Phase: For standard household appliances or small-scale use.
  - 60Hz, 127/220V Three Phase: For industrial equipment or higher-power applications.
- Some VFDs allow switching between these configurations or even simultaneous outputs, depending on their design.
 
 4. Circuit Protection and Distribution
- After conversion by the VFD, circuit protection devices (e.g., breakers, fuses, surge protectors) ensure safe operation by protecting against overloads or short circuits.
- The final output is distributed to power devices or stored in batteries for later use in remote locations.
 
 Why This Setup Works
1. Brushless Permanent Magnet Motor: Highly efficient and compact, ideal for small hydro setups.
2. VFD/Inverter: Provides flexibility to adjust frequency and voltage for specific applications.
3. Dual Output Configurations: Supports both residential and industrial power needs.
4. Remote Operation: The system can function autonomously in off-grid locations with minimal maintenance.
 
 Practical Example
Imagine a small hydroelectric generator installed near a remote cabin:
1. Water flows through a turbine connected to a brushless permanent magnet motor.
2. The motor generates high-frequency AC power (1600Hz, 400V).
3. A VFD converts this raw power into usable electricity at 60Hz, either as single-phase (110/120V) for household appliances or three-phase (127/220V) for larger equipment.
 
This modular system ensures efficient energy generation and versatile output options tailored to user needs.
Yes, a regenerative Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) can be used in this hydroelectric generator setup to provide regenerative energy. Here's how it works:
 
1. Energy Recovery: When the turbine drives the brushless permanent magnet motor, the VFD can capture the excess mechanical energy generated during operation and convert it into electrical energy. This is particularly useful when the system produces more power than needed at the moment.
 
2. DC Bus Utilization: The regenerative VFD directs the recovered energy back into its DC bus. This energy can either:
   - Be fed back into the grid if the system is grid-connected and the VFD has grid-tie capabilities.
   - Power other loads connected to the same DC bus, reducing overall energy consumption[2][3][5].
 
3. Efficiency and Control: Regenerative VFDs are equipped with advanced circuitry that allows them to manage bidirectional energy flow. They regulate motor speed and torque while efficiently recycling excess power, improving overall system efficiency and reducing waste[7][8].
 
4. **Practical Application in Hydro**: In a remote hydroelectric setup, a regenerative VFD could store excess energy in batteries or feed it into other local systems, ensuring no energy is wasted while maintaining precise control over motor speed and output frequency[1][3].
 
This makes regenerative VFDs ideal for sustainable and efficient small-scale hydroelectric systems.

Custom Panel is seeking a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) solution for a small hydroelectric generator system using a 6kW, 1600Hz, 400V brushless permanent magnet motor. The desired outputs are 60Hz at 110/120V single-phase and 127/220V three-phase. 
 
Custom Panel is looking for a complete package, similar to what we've done for Fairlead. 
 
 
I used to work at Fairlead Systems on the HES-C project that they partnered with Johnson Controls on. I didn't work with you directly, but I worked on and helped troubleshoot the HESC units after they were installed. So, I was copied on quite a few calls and emails. Anyway,  I am with Custom Panel and Controls now. We do similar work.
 
I have a customer asking us to assist with the design of a small hydro electric generator design for remote stand-alone use. The requirements are close to the spec on your Vericycle 75.
 
We would provide the turbine/motor, circuit protection, assembly, etc. We need assistance with inverter solution.
 
The motor they've selected in a brushless permanent magnet type, 6kw, 1600Hz, 400V. I think this is open to adjustment / change. 
 
Looking for two output configurations. One 60HZ 110/120V Single Phase and another 127/220v  60hz,  220v phase to phase.
 
I know there are many more variables that go into this, but that is the overall picture. If this is something Calnetix would be interested in, please let me know.

The application described seeks a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) solution for a small hydroelectric generator system using a 6kW, 1600Hz, 400V brushless permanent magnet motor. The desired outputs are 60Hz at 110/120V single-phase and 127/220V three-phase. Here's how to make sense of the requirements:
 
 Key Considerations:
1. Motor Compatibility: The motor's high frequency (1600Hz) and voltage (400V) require a VFD capable of handling these specifications while converting the output to desired frequencies and voltages. Brushless permanent magnet motors are efficient but need precise control, which modern VFDs can provide[1][3].
 
2. Output Configurations:
 

   - Single-phase 110/120V at 60Hz.
   - Three-phase 127/220V at 60Hz.
 
   A flexible inverter or VFD with programmable output settings is essential to meet these dual configurations.
 
3. Inverter Solution:
   - A regenerative VFD, like the HydroXS system, could be suitable as it adjusts turbine speed dynamically for optimal energy generation and offers precise control over output parameters[1].
   - Alternatively, systems like GE's Variable Speed Hydro Generators could provide robust solutions for efficiency and adaptability in remote setups[5].
 
4. Additional Adjustments: If the motor specs are adjustable, consider selecting one with lower frequency or voltage to simplify the VFD requirements and reduce costs.
 
 Recommendations:
- Explore regenerative VFDs designed for micro-hydro applications, such as those integrating programmable logic controls for dynamic adjustments[1][3].
- Consult manufacturers like Calnetix or GE Vernova for tailored solutions that align with these specifications and output needs[2][5].
 
This approach ensures compatibility between the turbine, motor, and electrical output system while maintaining efficiency in remote operations.

MSTIC Reverse Industry Day
Monday, November 25, 2024
1:36 PM
 
Email thread
Good afternoon MSTIC,
 
You may remember from our last event that MSTIC is going to host a Reverse Industry Day at our upcoming event, on March 11, 2025.  This event will be open to selected members that submit their proposed topic and solutions by the January 8, 2025, deadline.
 
Why have a Reverse Industry Day? The decision was made based on the desire from membership to bring ideas to the table and from NSWCPD to hear directly from membership in a setting where they are free to speak in depth to their proposed solutions. 
 
What is the MSTIC Reverse Industry Day? It is a NSWCPD and ATI hosted event for selected solutions based on our solution rating criteria:
 
Green     
The Solution has sufficient technical merit and has the potential to successfully address the success criteria of the focus area. Certain aspects of the Solution may require refinement.
Yellow
The Solution may have sufficient technical merit and has the potential to successfully address the success criteria of the focus area. Certain aspects of the Solution require refinement.
Red
The Solution does not have sufficient technical merit or does not address the requirements of the focus area.

 
Solutions rated Green or Yellow may be invited to present at the March 11th event or at a future Reverse Industry Day. Solutions rated Red will not be requested to present. Feedback will only be in the form of a request to present at the March event or a later event. The presenters selected for March 11th and future events, from this cycle, will be notified by 2/12/2025. 
 
The Reverse Industry Day will be by invite only and while adjacent to the MSTIC 25-02 Collaboration Event, it will be a separate event. Presenters will only present to Government representatives and once they have completed their presentation, they will be escorted from the room and their presentation will be evaluated.  At a scheduled time, the next presenter will be escorted into the room for their presentation. 
 
On December 5th, 2024, at 2:00 ET we will host a virtual information webinar to go over additional details on the event and provide additional resources and points of contact.  The attached document gives the identified Technology focus areas for your submissions. The submission form can be found here. You may submit to as many topics as you like but each topic must be a separate submission. 
 
 
MSTIC is allowing to submit proposed topics and solutions by Jan 8th.  From the topic list attached, the following could be interesting to us to submit on: 
 
NSWCPD understands that the MSTIC Consortium members are on the cutting edge of technologies within the MSTIC Focus Areas and may have developed or are in progress of developing solutions to problems that have not yet been presented as Statements of Need by the Government. NSWCPD is interested in capturing these concepts and solutions from private industry as projects to potentially be executed via the MSTIC OTA.  The goal of these projects is to enhance sustainment, reliability, and maintainability of critical HM&E systems  related to the following:
 
Power And Energy:
Modeling and Simulation
Fault/Arc-Flash Assessments - ETAP/SKM platforms
Large/Small Scale Transient Assessments - Matlab platform
Common Mode Assessments - Matlab/PLECS platform
Machine Learning - Algorithm Development
Advanced Prototyping - MIL-STD compliant Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) at scale (and associated components, like EMI filters etc.).
 
My thoughts are:
SiC HESC drive (item c)
HESC middle shelf Common Mode - Getting ahead of the funding issue for Common Mode on DDG125 (item iii)
Let me know if you agree and we can work on this for December.
 
 
Thanks for sharing. Both makes sense and I believe we have strong case for both.

Not many suppliers for 208VAC 30kW solution but they're looking for 30kW solution OTS no development. 
 
The 480VAC opportunity is still on hold he's waiting on the government to make a decision (didn't say exactly what though)
 
Development put on hold for generator if pricing is reasonable he'll pull corporate to make a decision
 
Commercial pricing wanted for defense related. He mentioned they are looking for a unicorn fit for this product capable of going on multiple platforms.
If we have generator stuff we can send then send it he'll pass it on no aerospace pricing but fit form and function works over pricing the power is 60kW
 
They want competition, different packaging is necessary i.e. square vs rectangle 
 
208VAC 3-Phase inverter (~30kW)
 
480VAC 3-Phase inverter (~160kW) is the High Velocity Gun Weapon System (HVGWS) program. This has to be off the shelf. No development time.
 
any pancake generators (~60kW)
These functional blocks will be packaged into modules to allow the flexibility in the configuration necessary to deliver the required performance, but in a manner that minimizes cost and weight.
 
These functional blocks will be assembled into modular units, offering the flexibility to configure as needed for performance while keeping cost and weight to a minimum.
 
Additional requirements for the concept include
 
<<Army_SBIR_244_R23.pdf>> 
 
 
 
208 VAC 3-Phase 30kW Inverter
 
        •        System Type: Could you confirm whether you're looking for a 3-wire or 4-wire system?
        •        Timeline: What is your expected timeline for this program? I would be happy to schedule a call to discuss our current solutions for products with these specifications and provide an overview of how we might support your needs.
 
480 VAC 3-Phase 160kW Inverter
 
        •        DC Input: Could you specify the DC input requirements for this system?
        •        Solution Fit: We believe our fully developed DC-1000 could be a strong fit for this application.
 
60kW Pancake Generator
 
        •        Requirements: Could you share more details on the motor requirements, such as RPM? We specialize in magnetic bearing motor technology, and depending on the speed requirements, our product may or may not be ideal. However, we collaborate closely with a company that provides pancake generators capable of operating at lower speeds and could offer an effective solution.
 
Please let me know if you'd like to set up a call or if you have further details on any of these requirements. I look forward to assisting you with your project.
 
 
1. Current Power Requirements
30 kW at 208 VAC
They seek an off-the-shelf (OTS) solution—no development work preferred.
Not many suppliers offer this exact specification.
Will follow up and try to find out what the timeline is.
480 VAC Opportunity High Velocity Gun Weapon System
Still on hold, pending a government decision (no further details shared).
60 kW Power (Generator-Related)
Interested in reviewing any existing generator products.
Program currently on hold.
Emphasized commercial pricing (no premium aerospace pricing).
Fit, form, and function are key considerations; pricing remains a critical factor.
 
2. Development & Decision Process
Generator Program on Hold
If pricing is found acceptable, the contact will involve corporate to move forward.
Looking for a “unicorn fit” that can function on multiple platforms.
Packaging Considerations
Need different form factors (e.g., square vs. rectangular) to accommodate diverse vehicle/platform designs.
Desire for Competition
They want to see multiple suppliers offering similar solutions to ensure competitive pricing and designs.
 
3. Key Action Items & Notes
Send Generator Information
Provide data sheets or materials on any existing 60 kW or relevant power solutions.
Must emphasize commercial pricing approach.
Focus on OTS & Minimal Development
Oshkosh aims to reduce lead times and costs by sourcing ready-made solutions where possible.
Awaiting Government Decisions
Be aware that 480 VAC program timing depends on external factors outside Oshkosh's immediate control.
 
Summary:
Oshkosh is actively exploring 30 kW (208 VAC) off-the-shelf solutions and may later revisit a 60 kW offering if the pricing and fit meet their needs. Their 480 VAC effort is paused pending government input. They emphasize competitive, commercial-style pricing, modular packaging, and minimal development overhead to fit multiple vehicle platforms.
 
Oshkosh
 
 
Please send me any information you have on a 208VAC 3-Phase inverter (~30kW), 480VAC 3-Phase inverter (~160kW), and any pancake generators (~60kW).
 
For the both inverters are you looking for a 3-wire or 4-wire system?
 
208 VAC 3-Phase 30kW
What is your time frame for this program? I'd like to jump on a call with you and give a high level of what we're doing to address the common need for a product with these specifications.
 
480 VAC 3-Phase 160kW
What is the DC input on this system? 
I believe we can use our fully developed DC-1000 for this application.  
 
Pancake Generator 60kW
Do you mind sharing the requirements for this motor (rpm, etc.)? We specialize in magnetic bearing motor technology so depending on the speed requirements our product may not be the best option. However, we do work very closely with another company that is fully capable of providing a pancake generator that runs at lower speeds.
 
125kW for DRS
Why not 125kW from Allision and DRS 
 
How is doing a solution without a transformer 
Anyone else can be of use

**Introduction:**
 
This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to solicit proposals for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle Electrical Power Architecture (NGCVEPA) Integrated Energy Power Conversion (IEPC) solution. The NGCVEPA system is a critical component in the ongoing efforts of the Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) to support the electrification and hybridization of military combat vehicles. The primary goal of this initiative is to develop a robust, lightweight, and highly efficient power conversion system capable of handling both AC import and DC export with various power levels and voltage configurations.
 
The system is designed to meet stringent military environmental requirements, operating effectively in temperatures ranging from -40°C to 71°C. It will utilize cutting-edge wide-bandgap semiconductor technologies, specifically Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), to deliver high-efficiency power conversion. This architecture must support multiple modes, including rectification (AC import) and inverting (DC export) at power levels of up to 30kW while maintaining a compact form factor at 66 pounds and a volume of 1490 cubic inches (12.75" x 15.29" x 7.64").
 
We request that your company provides the following information as part of your response:
- Experience with wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC and GaN) in military applications
- Understanding and capability to meet military environmental standards and requirements
- Past work experience with similar power electronics developments
- A non-binding Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the design and build of the IEPC solution
 
We look forward to reviewing your proposal as we continue to advance the electrification of next-generation combat vehicles in collaboration with industry partners.

Recognizing that size and weight are critical factors in these confined environments, Calnetix has developed innovative strategies to significantly reduce both, without increasing control complexity or costs.
 
Innovative Inverter Technology Using Interleaved Topology
 
Our approach centers on utilizing an interleaved inverter topology to achieve high power density in a compact form factor. In this design, gate signals for interleaved legs in each phase are phase-shifted by half of the switching cycle. This technique dramatically reduces current ripple in the system, as the summation current of two inductors effectively cancels out ripple, thereby reducing the strain on the filter capacitors. As demonstrated, this method decreases peak-to-peak ripple current by at least 50% compared to a traditional non-interleaved inverter, allowing for a significant reduction in the required inductance value.
 
By implementing this interleaved topology, Calnetix achieves a considerable reduction in size and weight. For instance, a 30kW base inverter module utilizing this design weighs approximately 38.5 pounds. This compact size enables integration with a DC-DC converter module while still meeting the stringent volumetric constraints of submarine systems.
 
Leveraging Additive Manufacturing for Weight Optimization
 
To further reduce weight and enhance cooling efficiency, Calnetix employs additive manufacturing techniques for structural components. This approach allows for complex, integrated coolant flow paths without the need for additional fluid connections, improving thermal management. Additionally, by utilizing plastic as the primary material and metallizing it for durability and environmental resistance, we achieve a significant weight reduction. In comparison to traditionally machined aluminum cold plates, our additively manufactured cold plates with integrated aluminum substructures are approximately 50% lighter, reducing the weight by about 5 pounds.
 
Advanced Enclosure and Inductor Design
 
The enclosure design incorporates a foil-embedded carbon fiber structure, optimizing weight while maintaining environmental protection and EMI shielding. By embedding expanded metal foil within a lightweight carbon fiber housing, we achieve the same durability as aluminum enclosures with a weight reduction of up to 30%, potentially saving around 1 pound per enclosure.
 
Additionally, our high-capacity inductor design benefits from the interleaved topology by requiring significantly lower inductance values. By integrating advanced cooling solutions like heat pipes and graphene interface pads, we increase current density, enabling the design to deliver higher performance. This results in inductors that are only 25% of the weight of conventional designs, reducing the total system weight by approximately 30 pounds.
 
Conclusion
 
Calnetix's innovative inverter solutions leverage interleaved topologies, additive manufacturing, and advanced materials to significantly reduce size and weight, meeting the Navy's stringent requirements for space-constrained applications. Our lightweight, high-density inverter technology not only enhances performance but also provides a more efficient, reliable, and space-saving solution for next-generation submarine platforms.

Since the size and weight are critical elements for this application, the aim of this proposal is to reduce them considerably without adding complexity to the control algorithm nor increasing the cost. Therefore, to have a compact solution to achieve high power density, an interleaved inverter topology is being proposed which is shown in Figure 4. In this configuration, the gate signals of interleaved legs in each phase are phase shifted by half of the switching cycle which is shown at left side of in Figure 4. The main advantage of this approach is current ripple reduction of the summation current of two inductors (noted by iLa_Summation /iLb_Summation /iLc_Summation in Figure 4) which is mainly going into filter capacitor, in other words current ripple cancellation. As shows in Figure 5, the normalized peak to peak ripple current in 2-leg interleaved 3-phase inverter is at least half of the same in non-interleaved 3-phase inverter at any moment of line cycle. It is worth noting that Figure 5 shows only half of line cycle (180 degrees) since other second half cycle is repeating the same. This approach helps to reduce the required inductance value by half and keep the same current ripple going into filter capacitor.
The perimeter requirement of at least 48” to allow sufficient space for lifters drives a volumetric aspect ratio. Utilizing the inverter topology described above and the techniques following, Calnetix is able to achieve ~38.5lb weight for a 30kW base inverter module. This allows the 30kW base inverter module to be paired with the DC-DC converter module and still be within the weight target. Taking advantage of additive manufacturing methods has multiple benefits. First, it allows for a complex integral geometry of the coolant flow path, eliminating internal fluid connections while increasing cooling effectiveness where needed. Second, it allows for the majority of the structure to be made of plastic which has a lower density than metal. The plastic can be metallized to provide desirable surface characteristics such as environmental resistance and durability while metallic substructures can be integrated into the primary structure to achieve additional strength or thermal performance selectively and optimally where needed. When comparing a traditionally machined structural cold plate, an additively manufactured structural cold plate metallized with integrated aluminum substructures could potentially be half the weight, in this instance ~5lbs.
3.3.2 Foil Embedded Carbon Fiber Enclosure
Having an integrated structural cold plate is ideal as it reduces the structural requirements of the enclosure. The non-structural covers of the enclosure can be designed to achieve environmental protection from solid and liquid ingress as well as EMI. Embedding one or multiple layers of expanded metal foil into a traditional carbon fiber housing structure allows for a very thin and lightweight structure to achieve environmental protection. This configuration could potentially weigh 30% less than an aluminum sheet metal design, potentially reducing the weight by 1 lb.
3.3.3 High-Capacity Inductor Design
Optimally designed inductors for the L-C filter combined with lower inductance due to an interleaved topology have a significant impact on the weight of the overall package. Integrating advanced cooling solutions such as heat pipes and graphene interface pads into the inductor construction allows for higher current densities in the conductors and therefore more performance can be pushed from the design. The weight of a high-capacity inductor for an interleaved topology could be 25% of that of a commercially available inductor for a traditional inverter topology, potentially reducing the total system weight by 30lbs.

If there is no pre-charge feature or internal feature to handle cold start a peak voltage it will cause the Capacitor to overload because it will draw to much current in order to charge.
The DC source will see a short in turn see a shortage and potentially not start.
 
LM has a DC source with pre-charge capabilities. 
 
If the DC source does not have this feature and we have to do this internally it would take up about 75 cubic inches of volume increasing the weight.

4x4x4 = 64 in^3
2x4x1 = 8 in^3
1.5x1.5x1.5 = 3.375 in^3

Recommendation is to have another meeting to discuss Pana's designs prior to getting Ryan involved for Packaging.
 
 
Questions
 
Before we finalize the system architecture following items must be considered/answered!
Output requirement: is 3 phase and Pe or 3 phase + Neutral + Pe (Protective Earth)?
If the answer to item 1 is 3 phase + Neutral + Pe and the DC source is ungrounded (floating), will create a simple single conversion architecture.
If the answer to item 1 is 3 phase + Neutral + Pe and the DC source is grounded (not floating), will create a double conversion (more complicated) architecture.
Cooling: Liquid or air?
Control power supply: Externally supplied 28V. If this is not the case the architecture has to incorporate power supply circuits.
Limit on output voltage harmonic, Vthd%?
Loading limitations and % voltage regulation under these conditions: %unbalance (or none!), crest factor (or none!), Overload ratings (or none!)?
System paralleling questions:
Is it capacity sharing or redundancy sharing
Lead-follower (Master slave) configuration
Phase lock loop
Sharing scheme (transient and steady state)
Fault isolation
Answers to these questions will have major implications to the architecture that we choose.
Regarding the power to volume analysis, we should create 3 metrics
Total volume (kw/L)
Power conversion volume (kw/L)
Sine filter volume (kw/L)
Including a neutral will allows for balanced loads across a 3 phase inverter. Having this provides better compatibility with various equipment that may require a neutral connection for a single phase load.
 
When the DC source is ungrounded, the inverter can operate with a single conversion stage, converting DC directly to AC. This approach simplifies the design, reduces complexity, and improves efficiency.
 
A grounded DC source necessitates a double conversion architecture to isolate the ground from the output and ensure safety and compliance with grounding requirements. This involves converting DC to AC and then back to DC before final AC conversion, adding complexity and potentially decreasing efficiency.
 
In general Liquid Cooling provides better thermal Management, essential for high-power inverters operating in harsh environments. Liquid Cooling can handle higher power densities as well.
 
THD Is Voltage Total Harmonic Distortion 
THD is used to quantify the distortion in voltage or current waveforms caused by the presence of harmonic frequencies other than the fundamental frequency (usually 50/60Hz)
 
A higher THD means more heating, higher peak currents, and higher core losses. 

 
Trying to accomplish a lower THD has the following implications:
 
Crest factor is the ratio of the instantaneous peak amplitude of a waveform, to its root mean square RMS value.
 
Crest factor is used to understand the behavior of the inverter under different load conditions.
A higher crest factor indicates higher peak currents and reduced power efficiency.
When determining the Crest Factor using a 3:1 when designing  for a 30kW 208V system I rms of 83.3A this means 250A  doubling the power rating. Using 1.621 is more applicable in general.

Meet with Pana and Liping
Fault Tolerance for parallel architecture
What should the device do if one inverter shorts in a parallel setup?
 
Pana concern is the 800DVC if anything shorts then all that voltage is on the bus
 
Which components in this design will contribute to the Total Harmonic Distortion?
 
Why does an export power supply need a power source? To power the internal circuitry and components.
 
Is Source Grounded vs Ungrounded
 
Force them to say ungrounded but general is grounded. Requests would generally be for grounded and ungrounded applications and for that reason it would have to be built assuming source is grounded which would require a isolator that can also handle the input voltage rating, grounded and then provides the plus minus connections. Size would be around 80% of the size essentially doubling the size of the machine.
 
Limit on output voltage harmonic, Vthd%?
From 5% to 3% it includes beefier capacitance. This is only a sizing matter doesn't affect architecture.
 
For Overload ratings 10 seconds is continuous and needs to be built as a 60kW machine. Overload doesn't apply to motor drives. So nothing to compare or base it off of. 
 
If there is no power source (28V) then the system becomes more difficult because a source must be incorporated into the system. Increasing the overall size. Most vehicles do have a 28V energy supply for other minor components.
 
Capacity Sharing 
Defined as a situation where the load is 60kW and we have 2 Inverters in parallel supporting that load. Each inverter is providing 30kW to equate to a 60kW power supply.
 
Redundancy Sharing
Defined as a situation where the load is only 30kW and there are two inverters in parallel ready to support the load. If one fails then the other will immediately take its place. However, there's a potential situation where one shorts and with no fault isolation system onboard the other inverter 
 
The moment we say the dc source is grounded then isolation is needed
Strong argument stating why source is grounded or ungrounded.
With research state why its either way
 
 
Can you confirm whether the DC source for a power export inverter application will be grounded or ungrounded?

Why the program change to OBVP?
Is this a new set of systems being built or retrofitting existing ones?

3) Operate as Type VII Power Conversion Equipment when operating within the Army's Tactical Microgrid Standard (MIL-STD-3071).
4) Achieve a 2-person lift. 
This inverter module will provide 208VAC, 3-phase @ 60Hz with 3-wire + ground, when supplied with 350-600VDC. The module design has been lightweighted to achieve the 2-person lift requirement. 
How this aligns
Distribution, Enablers, Generation, Maneuver, and Storage.
 
 
Here's an expanded alignment that includes the focus on ground vehicles:
 
Our proposed 30kW bi-directional inverter aligns with the FY25 Operational Energy Resilience (OER) priorities, including its application in ground vehicle hybridization and electrification (GVH&E):
 
        1.        Distribution
The inverter supports efficient, secure energy delivery across military operations, including ground vehicle systems. It enables interoperability with tactical microgrids and diverse environments, ensuring ground vehicles can effectively distribute power to support various equipment and auxiliary systems in the field.
        2.        Enablers
Designed for integration with tactical microgrids, the inverter enables real-time power management across platforms, improving operational efficiency. The compatibility with intelligent energy management systems supports ground vehicles by optimizing power allocation and enhancing decision-making capabilities, including power for vehicle-mounted equipment.
        3.        Generation
With on-site power generation, the inverter minimizes reliance on long supply chains, crucial for ground vehicles operating in remote or contested areas. It provides a stable, immediate power source that supports the independence and energy security of mobile ground units.
        4.        Maneuver
The lightweight design of the inverter supports easy deployment, meeting the two-person lift requirement, and facilitates rapid mobility for ground forces. It aligns with GVH&E goals of enhancing vehicle maneuverability and agility by providing reliable, exportable power that can adapt to various operational demands.
        5.        Storage Compatibility
The inverter's bidirectional capability integrates smoothly with energy storage in ground vehicles, increasing operational range and resilience. It enhances vehicle systems' ability to store and distribute energy, ensuring power availability across all conditions and supporting longer mission endurance.
        6.        Ground Vehicle Hybridization and Electrification
Our inverter supports the GVH&E objectives by providing efficient, high-density power that integrates with ground vehicle systems to reduce energy demands, improve maneuverability, and support new capabilities. Its design supports hybrid power systems, enabling energy to be harvested, stored, and managed effectively within the vehicle's power architecture.
 
We are interested in submitting a proposal for the FY25 Operational Energy - Innovation Funding under the PEB Cycle 2 for Non-Nuclear OECIF Projects. Our goal is to secure either a multi-year or one-year surge funding pathway to support the development of a 30kW bi-directional inverter that we believe, aligns with key operational energy needs described by the Operational Energy Resilience directive.
 
The inverter module we are proposing would achieve the following objectives:
 
1) Generate AC power in accordance with MIL-STD-1332B for a Class 2C generator.
2) Regulate DC voltage in accordance with MIL-STD-3071.
3) Operate as Type VII Power Conversion Equipment when operating within the Army's Tactical Microgrid Standard (MIL-STD-3071).
4) Achieve a 2-person lift. 
This inverter module will deliver 208VAC, 3-phase @ 60Hz with a 3-wire + ground configuration when supplied with a 350-600VDC input. This aligns directly with interests in advancing tactical microgrid compatibility, field-ready power solutions, and MIL-STD compliance for operational energy.

Input to an Inverter can be a battery, PV module, fuel cell, or any DC source.
 
Ancillary Devices - machines and other technical things which are used with the main items of equipment to create a complete system
 
Higher switching frequencies reduce the harmonic content (THD) in the output voltage and supply a sinusoidal waveform to the connected load. However, this results in the generation of EMI.

Tactical, Prime and Utility Electrical Power.
 
What actually powers devices
 
kVA is apparent power or Volt Amperage
You need  power factor to convert kW to kVA 
The power factor is the efficiency value of the electrical system.
Generators are generally .8
a 60-kW generator under normal conditions is 160-200 amperes. Therefore, a 60-kW generator should be paired with an M200 (200 ampere) distribution box with 200 ampere cabling. Anything less would not allow the full capacity of the generator to be utilized.
 
Tactical Electrical Power Less than 500kW Expectation is up to 6 months of organic energy. This type of electrical power is used to handle the energy needs of individual units. Power sources include individual power, generators, alternative and renewable sources of energy fuel cells and hybrid power.
 
 
Prime Electrical Power - Has the capability to provide continuous, reliable, commercial-grade, and medium-voltage power to support military operations. Consists of a centralized power plant and a medium-voltage distribution network that provide continuous and reliable power.
500kW and higher 
 
Utility Electrical Power
PCB's come completed by a supplier (GMA bought by OneMonroe) however due to low volume they may drop us and we'll need to move to a new supplier. 
Power output of generators decreases by 3.5 percent per 305 meters
(1,000 feet) of elevation above 1,219 meters (4,000 feet).
 
The DOD standard family of tactical generators can fulfill most organic power requirements. Prime power systems can be selected when distances and loads exceed those of tactical power systems. Utility power can be selected if it is compatible with mission equipment and reliable enough to suit the needs of the unit.
 
Tactical Electrical Power
These standard military generators are highly mobile, produce user voltages (120/208 volt, or 240/416 volt at 60 Hz and 230/400 at 50 Hz), do not require the use of transformers, and have an output capacity ranging from 2 kW to 500 kW.
Liping is the motor and drives expert he does all firmware and controls.
 
Our go-to means for communication is CAN bus but customers are requesting ethernet.
 
DSP Digital Signal Processor does all the mathematical calculations needed by the system. There are two types:
 
Fixed-Point which uses 16 bits for manipulating integers positive and negative. 2^16 possible patterns
 
Floating Point can manipulate rational numbers via a minimum of 32 bits 2^32 possible patterns
 
Gate Driver Boards
 
These drivers are power amplifiers that accepts a low power input from a controller and produces the appropriate high current necessary for control circuit and semiconductor devices like MOSFETS switching devices.
 
Gate drive circuits for power inverters and converters often require electrical isolation for both functional and safety purposes. Isolation is mandated by regulatory and safety certification agencies to prevent shock hazards. It also protects low voltage electronics from any damage due to faults on the high power side circuit and from human error on the control side. The electrical separation between various functional circuits in a system prevents a direct conduction path between them and allows individual circuits to possess different ground potentials. Signal and power can still pass between isolated circuits using inductive, capacitive or optical methods.
 
DC Droop Control is a technique used in power systems, particularly in microgrids and DC distribution networks, to manage power sharing among multiple power sources (such as generators, solar panels, batteries) that are connected to a common DC bus. The primary objective of DC Droop Control is to balance the load demand and ensure stable operation by adjusting the output voltage of each source based on its power contribution.
 
Advantages of DC Droop Control:
- Decentralized Control: It does not require communication between power sources, making the system simpler and more robust.
 
Applications:
- Microgrids: Where multiple distributed energy resources need to work together to supply power.
- Hybrid Power Systems: Combining different types of energy sources like solar, wind, and diesel generators.
 
DC Droop Control is a practical method for managing power distribution and ensuring stable and efficient operation in systems where multiple sources are connected to a common DC bus.
 
In inverter applications, interface boards are used to facilitate communication and signal processing between various components and systems. They serve several critical functions, including:
 
1. Signal Conditioning:
   - Interface boards adjust and convert signals from one form to another, ensuring compatibility between different components. For example, they may convert analog signals to digital signals or vice versa, adjust voltage levels, or filter out noise.
2. Isolation:
   - They provide electrical isolation between high-power components and low-power control circuits. This isolation protects sensitive control electronics from electrical surges and noise, improving system reliability and safety.
3. Communication:
   - Interface boards can manage communication between the inverter and external systems, such as a central control system, sensors, or user interfaces. They might include communication protocols like CAN, Modbus, RS-485, or Ethernet.
4. Control and Monitoring:
   - They can facilitate the monitoring of various parameters like voltage, current, temperature, and operational status. This data can be used for real-time control adjustments, diagnostics, and system protection.
5. Feedback and Control Signals:
   - Interface boards are used to receive feedback signals from sensors (such as temperature or speed sensors) and send control signals to the inverter to adjust its output accordingly.
6. Gate Drive Interface:
   - In some cases, interface boards serve as a bridge between the control electronics and the gate drivers of power electronic components like IGBTs or MOSFETs. They help ensure proper timing and control of the power devices.
7. Human-Machine Interface (HMI):
   - They can also serve as an interface between the inverter and a human operator, providing displays and input methods (such as buttons or touchscreens) for monitoring and controlling the system.

Government Feedback
 
The government is interested in the Inverter being able to grid-form an AC grid as well as parallel with a AC diesel genset.
120/230 Single phase for everything under 10kW  and 208-480V 3-phase for everything 10kW and above. The SIBER sets challenging voltage and power levels to encourage industry to develop versatile systems. However, the government aims to ensure the system is feasible for deployment. With this in mind, the target voltage for all power levels is 208V 3-phase.
The immediate goal for the SIBER is to design a single 30kW bidirectional inverter. However, the broader objective is to establish a "family of inverters." To that end, it is essential to keep the design as modular as possible, in alignment with the overarching goal of the SIBER.

Regarding the enclosure, usually we like to design enclosures for the converters, particularly due to specialized thermal requirements on the various components.  
What will the environmental situation be?  Do we need to worry about humidity or other exposures? 
 
 
We specialize in managing thermal and environmental requirements for our inverter systems, and your DC-DC converter would likely fit well within our solutions. It's great to hear that your enclosure design is optimized for thermal management. However, I want to be transparent—due to our constrained packaging size, we will likely need to remove the enclosure to ensure it fits within our system.
 
Additionally regarding operation and efficiency, if this is going into a bidirectional inverter stage, do you expect that when providing power from the battery to the output bus the power will regularly be the close to the power rating of the converter, or do you expect long periods of time at light load?
 
We expect that the DC-DC converter will experience long periods operating at light load rather than regularly operating close to its maximum power rating.

Previous paper covers an introduction to the DC-1000 and the push into export power using high power density bi-directional inverters for motoring and generating modes.
 
 
LEVERAGING HIGH POWER DENSITY, BI-DIRECTIONAL MOTOR DRIVE TO EXPORT POWER OFF VEHICLE
 
INTRODUCTION
With the increases in electrical demand, the need for exportable power off the vehicle has also increased.  Export power is poised to disrupt the tactical electrical power requirements as defined in ATP 3-34.45, Electric Power Generation and Distribution.  It will decrease the logistics burden, reduce the tactical equipment footprint, and provide the unit with the necessary agility for mobile operations.
Hybrid vehicle architectures and drivetrain-based power generation are enabling the ability for export power to become another source for tactical electrical power. With the developments in increasing the available onboard electrical power from the engine, while maintaining the same volume, higher voltage architectures and the use of Silicon Carbide (SiC) Wide Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, more power can be delivered without needing to increase space
 
Figure 1. Export power enabling architectures. (A) Series Hybrid, (B) Parallel Hybrid, and (C) Drivetrain Based Power Generation
 
claims or vehicle level cooling [1]. Figure 1 shows how the developments in hybrid vehicles and drivetrain-based power generation have created a high voltage internal DC bus that allows for a 600VDC input inverter to be used to generate export power.
Prior demonstrations have proven that drivetrain-based power generation system can deliver the same fuel efficiency in high power mode (30kW) or a 2-to-1 improvement in a low-power mode (less than 10kW) as compared to the equivalent Tactical Quiet Generators. [1] The next challenge is to deliver this same functionality in a package that can be integrated within the confines of the tactical and ground vehicle space constraints.
Calnetix Technologies has developed a high-frequency, high-power-density, and bi-directional inverter. Figure 2 shows the Enercycle DC-1000™ inverter which can export electric power up to 500kW from the internal 600VDC bus in a >11 kW/L package.  While the Enercycle DC-1000 inverter is able to convert the high voltage DC bus to three-phase VAC power, it needs to be scalable for the lower end of tactical power requirements and have harmonic distortion removal functionality incorporated to prevent damage to downstream loads.
 
ENERCYCLE DC-1000 INVERTER BACKGROUND
Calnetix Technologies is an industry partner in the Platform Electrification and Mobility (PEM) project, where the Enercycle DC-1000™ was first conceived. The PEM project aimed to develop the special technologies needed to electrify the Army's tracked tactical vehicles, where the Enercycle DC-1000 inverter, was created to pair with various motors/generators on a series hybrid tracked vehicle. [5]

The Enercycle DC-1000 has the following key features:
Universal bi-directional AC/DC inverter for automatic motoring and generating mode operation,
High-frequency SiC power switching devices,
Continuous output power up to 500 kW and transient output power up to 640 kW at the nominal 600 VDC and coolant temperatures of up to 105°C,

The Enercycle DC-1000 was originally designed to operate as a bi-directional inverter either as a motor drive or generator drive; however, the same hardware can be utilized to export power off the vehicle with some modifications as discussed below.
 
EXPORT POWER FUNCTIONALITY
To convert the AC output of the Enercycle DC-1000 to 208VAC, 3-phase output, Calnetix will employ the control scheme as shown in Figure 3. Digital sliding mode control (DSMC) is used for the inner current loop control. By using inner current loop control, the inverter is capable to limit the unexpected transient current and avoid the fault due to transient overloading. [4]
 
Figure 3: Simplified control scheme for export power.
 
The DSMC current control loop is implemented in stationary αβ frame since current loop has much higher bandwidth than voltage loop so higher order harmonics can also be controlled in stationary αβ frame. 
The voltage loop is implemented in synchronous reference frame with selected harmonics cancellation for both positive and negative sequence components. It can provide better performance in terms of reducing harmonics and supporting unbalanced load.  
For parallel operation, the phase lock loop (PLL) can be used to synchronize the Grid. Droop control and real time communication through CAN bus can be used to balance the load.
A high-frequency sine wave filter is required to complete the export power functionality of the Enercycle DC-1000, to “smooth” the output of the DC-1000 to a near sinusoidal waveform.  Sine wave filters are utilized to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD). They are protecting the downstream loads and improving the system efficiency.  These sine wave filters are designed and packaged based on the environmental requirements of the ground vehicle and the available liquid cooling system onboard the vehicle.  
Figure 4 shows the sine wave filter for 125kW export power integrated with a Enercycle DC-1000 inverter. The sine wave filter can be provided in a single enclosure with the inverter or can be packaged separately, allowing greater flexibility in the installation of the equipment on the vehicle.  It should be noted that the inverter and sine wave filter should be co-located due to the high frequency power output of the inverter.  As frequency increases, current flow within a conductor becomes more concentrated near the surface, resulting in less skin depth, which affects the size of the cabling.

Scalability and Expansion
In order to be relevant to all combat vehicles and many tactical vehicles, the export power components must be paired with existing tactical power distribution systems and be scalable to any power level required by ground vehicles.  These considerations must be taken into account as the building blocks for supplying power are established. Table 1 shows potential building blocks for export power to be able to provide scalable solutions.

CHALLENGES
Challenges do exist for the adoption of export power and common equipment within the vehicle.  Some of these challenges are (1) the wide range of DC Input voltage due to unregulated energy storage system output and (2) the power density of filtering.  
Regulation of the internal vehicle DC bus is a trade study that is taking place, where the volume and efficiency of a high voltage DC converter for the energy storage system are being evaluated against pushing the wide range of output to the downstream components on the DC bus.  The potential for ~400V input range affects the sizing of the componentry and efficiency of the export power system. With a wide range of operation, there is the potential that the inverter portion of the export power system is not being operated to its full capacity because it is designed for the high current and high voltage, but doesn't operate at this condition, i.e. it operates either at low voltage, high current or high voltage, low current.
As volume is a premium on ground vehicles, further investigations are required to increase the overall power density of solutions provided.  While investments have been made to move power electronics to SiC WBG semiconductive solutions, additional developments are required to catch the ancillary components up. For example in Figure 4, Image (2) depicts a sine wave filter that is a ~25% the power capability of the Enercycle DC-1000, but twice the size.  One opportunity to decrease the filter size is by increasing the inverter PWM switching frequency.
 
CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS
As presented above there is an opportunity to deploy a common solution in multiple electronic components on ground and tactical vehicles.  Commonization benefits the vehicle because as technology improvements are made, it can be distributed into multiple functions within the vehicle, such as leveraging the power dense inverter solution developed for the powertrain into the export power functionality.  Calnetix is currently working on showcasing the Enercycle DC-1000's ability to provide the export power functionality as detailed in the sections above by the end of 2024. 
In order to make export power commercially viable with a common architecture the following steps must be taken:
Establish the building blocks for inverters that will accomplish the tactical power needs spectrum and deliver the rotational power conversion needs for generators and motors within the vehicle powertrain.
Continue to push for higher power dense solutions
Establish the acceptable voltage range for energy storage system operation

To incorporate the snubber capacitors within the existing envelope of the DC-1000 Inverter and have them as close as possible to the SiC MOSFET devices, the existing busbars were modified to allow for their installation while ensuring enough copper remained for in busbar to still carry the required current.
 
Through iterative testing and ongoing monitoring, we focused on capturing detailed current measurements while simultaneously tracking voltage levels across the device.
 
In addition to this analysis, it was determined to utilize snubber capacitors within the system by modifying the busbars with 12 snubber capacitors (0.33 µF each). Previous tests without snubber capacitors had shown varied DC voltage overshoot values for the same register current level. During low-side double pulse tests, the system experienced leakage current with increasing bus voltage. At 600VDC the leakage corresponded to a power consumption of nearly 10kW with 16 A of leakage current. Yet, on the high-side double pulse tests did not exhibit any leakage current.

Electrical Analysis
Test Objective:
The primary goal of this evaluation is to verify the performance of the DC-1000 under progressively increasing current and power levels. Our focus is to ensure that the unit not only meets the design specifications for voltage regulation and current handling but also accurately reflects the behavior of critical parameters such as VDS, output current, and output voltage under different operating conditions. This analysis also examines the impact of snubber circuits on voltage performance.
Test Setup:
The system is configured with a variable load to allow for incremental increases in current and power, simulating real-world operating conditions. High-precision sensors and data acquisition systems are used to monitor key parameters continuously. In this iterative testing process, we are focusing heavily on current measurements while also tracking voltage levels across the device. Tests are systematically performed at higher setpoints, ensuring that each step provides clear insights into the unit's electrical behavior and robustness.
Test Conditions:
DC Voltage: 600VDC
Setpoint Power: 205kW
Recorded Parameters: 
VDS: 1.165kV
Arms: 424.6A
Switching Frequency: 25kHz
DC Current/Voltage: 258.2A / 598.0VDC
Actual Power Output: 152.6kW
Test Results:
The evaluation demonstrated that the measured VDS of 1.165kV aligns well within our expected operational margins, while the output current readings confirm robust current handling capabilities, with a recorded RMS current of 424.6A. Operating at a switching frequency of 25kHz, the system maintained stability and demonstrated consistent performance across a range of increasing loads. Although the target setpoint was 205kW, the actual power output was recorded at 152.6kW under a 600VDC input condition. Additionally, tests comparing VDS measurements with and without the snubber circuit provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our protective measures. These results are part of our ongoing efforts to push the DC-1000 to higher current and power levels, ensuring that it meets and exceeds the rigorous demands of its intended applications.
 
Snubber Capacitor Evaluation:
As part of our ongoing electrical analysis, we modified the busbars and integrated 12 snubber capacitors (0.33µF each) into the inverter for evaluation, primarily due to lead time considerations. Testing under a 600VDC condition at 500A RMS revealed a voltage overshoot of 850VDC—a 250VDC increase over the expected value. Previous tests without the snubber capacitors had shown varied overshoot values, with one instance registering 902VDC at 392A and another at 335VDC at the same current level, underscoring the influence of these modifications on system behavior.
During low-side double pulse tests, we observed significant leakage currents accompanied by notable voltage overshoots, with leakage current increasing in tandem with bus voltage. At 600V, this leakage corresponded to an estimated power consumption of nearly 10kW with 16A of leakage current. In contrast, high-side double pulse tests did not exhibit any leakage current. These discrepancies have prompted further investigation into potential causes, including defective Mitsubishi SiC modules (FMF800DX-24A), or low-side SiCs not fully turning on—potentially due to the gate driver board's output of +15V/-10V rather than the recommended +15V/-15V.
Additionally, our double pulse test results suggest that the voltage overshoot might be too high to meet the full current requirement, possibly as a result of excessive busbar impedance. To mitigate this, we are considering a busbar redesign, including reorienting the bus capacitor 180° toward the inverter modules instead of the static switch modules to significantly reduce inductance. We are also addressing concerns related to potential overheating of the snubber capacitors and are working with Cissoid to tune the gate resistors to achieve a better balance between switching losses and voltage overshoot. It's important to note that the observed overshoot voltage does not appear proportional to the current—a discrepancy that might be attributed to our current measurement methods, which capture only phase current rather than the actual current in the SiC module legs. Further testing and firmware tuning with EDU1 are ongoing to refine these observations and optimize the system performance.

The corresponding voltage overshoot is also observed.
Leakage current increases with the increase of bus voltage.
Calculated power consumption is almost 10kW at 600V with 16A leakage.
No leakage current when doing high side double pulse tests. 
Possible reasons: 
Defective Mitsubishi SiC Modules (FMF800DX-24A).
Low side SiCs are not fully turned ON. 
Gate driver board output voltage is: +15V/-10V.
Recommended typical gate voltage from Mitsubishi datasheet is +15V/-15V
Based on the double pulse test results, the voltage overshoot seems like too high. It may not be able to meet our full current requirement. 
Possible reason: 
The busbar impedance is too high.
Possible solutions:
Redesign the busbar and turn the bus capacitor 180° to toward the inverter modules instead of static switch modules will help to reduce the bus inductance significantly. 
Adding snubber caps
 Any concerns of overheating the snubber caps? 
Cissoid to tune the gate resistors to balance the switching losses and voltage overshoot. 
Overshoot voltage is not proportional to the current.
If overshoot is due to bus inductance, the overshoot voltage shall be proportional to the leg current.
We only measure the phase current. We are not able to measure SiC module leg current.
Possible reason: 
Inconsistent leg current di/dt due to having two SiC modules in parallel.
Possible solutions:
This issue will not be critical if the bus inductance is low enough.
Cissoid to tune the gate drivers.

During the thermal performance test, a clear plastic (high reflectivity) cover was placed on the inverter so that thermal camera can be used too to check the internal components' temperature
 
To meet the sustainability plan laying out steps to move toward the goal of making ground vehicles in the U.S. military climate-friendly, vehicle electrification concept has been adopted significantly.
 
The obtained experimental results has confirmed the well performance of the DC-1000 inverter design, as built, and its capability of achieving a maximum continuous output current of 800ARMS and operating at 105°C inlet coolant temperatures.
 
The EnercycleTM DC-1000 Inverter was developed for military hybrid ground vehicles in an effort to create a high-frequency, high temperature operating bi-directional inverter in a power dense package. This paper presents the design and some test results of the DC-1000 Inverter.  Details regarding the thermal evaluation and electrical performance are discussed
 
The testing setup, shown in Figure 4, consists of a custom cooling cart attached to the inverter to provide a controlled and constant flow of EGW coolant to the system. The inverter's primary DC bus was loaded using a DC load bank to replicate high-power scenarios expected from the military vehicle
Two prototype units were built and tested at the Calnetix facility to verify their thermal performance against design requirements. The primary goal was to ensure that the as-built hardware closely matched the thermal analysis, allowing for accurate extrapolation to the full operating envelope. Thermal measurements showed consistent heat dissipation across critical components, confirming each unit's ability to safely and reliably operate at elevated temperatures.
 
A key design objective for the DC-1000 is to sustain continuous operation at power outputs up to 500 kW without exceeding the temperature limits of the power modules and other critical components. The DC-1000 has undergone an evaluation of its thermal performance shown in Figure 5 where an IR thermal image of the inverter can be seen. 
 
Thermal Analysis
Test Objective:
The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the DC-1000's thermal performance under conditions that mimic in-field load demand. Specifically, we aimed to verify that the as-built unit performs in line with our thermal analysis predictions, enabling reliable extrapolation to full design envelope conditions while maintaining safe operating temperatures.
Test Setup:
Load Simulation: A three-phase inductive load was used to replicate real-world load demands.
Visibility: To monitor internal component temperatures during operation, a clear, high-reflectivity plastic cover was installed on the device.
Additional Heating: Immersion heaters were added to the system to rapidly increase the coolant temperature.
Test Conditions:
DC Voltage: 600V
AC Current: 600A (peak-to-peak)
Switching Frequency: 10 kHz
Inlet Fluid: 50/50 EGW at ~36 LPM, heated to 90°C
Figure 5 displays the IR thermal image of the inverter taken after these test conditions were established.
Test Results:
After about five hours, the cooling circuit reached the desired temperature of 90°C. At steady state, IR thermography and strategically placed thermocouple (TC) readings captured the temperatures of critical components. These measurements were then extrapolated to reflect conditions at a 105°C inlet coolant temperature. The extrapolated temperatures for the HV sense board, DSP board, and interface boards maintained margins of 5-15°C below their maximum allowable values. Additionally, the measured temperatures aligned well with our finite element analysis (FEA) simulation of the enclosure. The results also confirmed that the planned thermal mitigations—such as heat pipes, thermal pads, and heat spreaders—effectively conducted heat through the busbars, connectors, and enclosure walls to the cold plate, which serves as the sole heat removal mechanism in the design.
A three-phase inductive load was utilized to replicate in-field load demand. The units demonstrated stable voltage regulation and frequency control, while also limiting THD to within acceptable thresholds. 
 
 
3. TESTING AND EVALUATION
Two prototype units were built and tested at the Calnetix facility to evaluate the inverter's thermal performance and validate compliance with stringent military standards for rugged, safe, and reliable operation in harsh environments. In addition to assessing heat dissipation capabilities, the tests focused on maintaining voltage regulation and frequency stability under varying loads, protecting both the system and its users via robust safety features, and limiting harmonic distortion to ensure clean power delivery.
 
 
 
 
 
Two prototype units of the inverter design were built and tested at the Calnetix facility to evaluate thermal performance under realistic military conditions. The primary objective was to confirm that the system could maintain safe operating temperatures at elevated coolant levels—approaching 105 °C—while still adhering to rigorous military standards. A three-phase inductive load was utilized for the trials, combining inductors in series with fixed-resistance load banks to replicate demanding field scenarios. Over multiple test intervals, the prototypes demonstrated stable voltage regulation and frequency control, while limiting harmonic distortion to within acceptable thresholds. Measurements showed consistent heat dissipation across critical components, validating that the design can sustain higher coolant temperatures without compromising safety or performance. In addition, the tests confirmed robust user protection and reliable operation under heavy loads, ensuring the inverter meets the Army's requirements for silent watch, power quality, and harsh environmental resilience.

Test Setup
 
Testing was conducted by interfacing the inverter with a custom cooling cart designed to provide a controlled and consistent flow of ethylene-glycol/water (EGW) coolant to the system. A 50/50 EGW mixture was delivered at a flow rate of approximately 36LPM and held at a 90°C inlet temperature throughout the test to simulate elevated vehicle operating conditions. The inverter's primary DC bus was loaded with up to 600A peak DC, replicating high-power scenarios expected in advanced military hybrid-electric platforms.
 
To accurately capture temperature profiles, thermocouples were placed at multiple key locations on the inverter, including on power modules, busbars, and the enclosure walls. These sensors fed real-time data to a multi-channel data acquisition system, enabling continuous monitoring and logging of component temperatures under varying load conditions. Additional instrumentation on the cooling cart measured coolant inlet and outlet temperatures, ensuring precise tracking of thermal transfer and any resulting rise in coolant temperature.
 
Throughout the test, the inverter was operated at incrementally higher DC current levels, observing both steady-state performance and transient behavior. The 36LPM flow of 90°C coolant effectively carried away heat generated by high current operation, validating the liquid cooling approach and confirming safe thermal limits under realistic, high-load conditions.
 
The DC-1000 inverter underwent comprehensive thermal testing to validate its ability to maintain safe operating temperatures under realistic military conditions. By carefully measuring conduction paths through busbars, boards, and enclosure walls—alongside the effectiveness of its liquid coolant flow (50/50 ethylene-glycol and water) and any radiative heat exchange—the design was confirmed to manage approximately 153 watts of internal heat losses distributed across various PCB assemblies and busbar connections. Instrumented data were collected while circulating 90°C coolant at 25 LPM, reflecting typical vehicle operating scenarios.
 
Test results demonstrated that component temperatures stayed below their respective 125°C limits across all critical areas. Measurements on FET driver boards, DSP boards, and interface boards showed margins of 18-30°C from maximum allowable values, indicating solid thermal headroom. Additionally, busbars and connectors effectively conducted heat to the enclosure walls, supplemented by external convection at 5 W/m²·K and a modest contribution from radiative cooling.
 
The presence of thermally conductive foam in certain sections helped distribute heat away from localized hotspots. For instance, a 4.5 mm layer between the HV sense board and busbar plate limited observed board temperatures to around 107°C—comfortably within safe bounds. Even where no foam was used, epoxy layers and copper conduction paths kept components below their rated limits, reinforcing the inverter's robust thermal design in high ambient and coolant temperatures.
 
Overall, these empirical measurements confirm that the DC-1000's combination of liquid cooling, targeted insulation, and carefully selected materials maintains components within safe temperature margins during continuous, high-power operations. Going forward, potential refinements include optimizing foam placement to further reduce peak temperatures, examining transient load conditions for short-term spikes, and verifying performance under more variable coolant conditions.

The US Army is amidst an ambitious plan to electrify its vehicles, not only to satisfy its climate initiatives [1] [2], but also to leverage the performance and logistical advantages provided by electrification. Examples of performance and logistical advantages of electrified vehicles include higher torque at lower speeds, lower noise and “silent watch” capabilities, lower maintenance costs, lower fuel costs, and reduced reliance on resupplies. The US Army plans to leverage rapid advancements in the commercial electric vehicle (EV) sector and first electrify non-tactical vehicles and then move into tactical wheeled vehicles [3].
Tracked tactical vehicles, such as the infantry fighting vehicles and battle tanks, have different performance requirements from commercial EVs with tracked tactical vehicles requiring power in the range of 100 kW to 1000 kW. The Platform Electrification and Mobility (PEM) project [4] aims to develop the special technologies needed to electrify the Army's tracked tactical vehicles. Calnetix Technologies is an industry partner in the PEM project and is developing a high-frequency, high-power-density, bi-directional inverter for the project, the Enercycle DC-1000™ (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Image of Enercycle DC-1000 universal bidirectional 500-kW AC/DC silicon-carbide inverter.
The Enercycle DC-1000 has the following key features:
•Universal bi-directional AC/DC inverter for automatic motoring and generating mode operation,
•High-frequency silicon-carbide (SiC)power switching devices,
•Continuous power output of 500 kW and transient output of 640 kW at a nominal600 VDC and coolant temperatures of up to 105°C,
•Three 600-V DC power distribution interfaces,
•High-voltage DC and AC safety interlock,
•DSP (Digital Signal Processor) based high-speed sensored and sensorless control algorithms,
•Supports parallelization of inverters for increased power capacity,
•Ambient operating temperature from-40°C to 120°C,
•Designed to meet vehicle vibration standards,
•Total volume of 45 L.
Figure 2 shows a high-level system schematic of the Enercycle DC-1000. The Enercycle DC-1000 can be universally implemented in many architectures such as series-hybrid, parallel-hybrid, and all-electric (Figure 3). Applications for such an inverter could extend beyond ground vehicles to naval vessels and airborne systems.
 
 
With the increases in electrical demand, the need for exportable power off the vehicle has also increased.  Export power is poised to disrupt the tactical electrical power requirements as defined in ATP 3-34.45, Electric Power Generation and Distribution.  It will decrease the logistics burden, reduce the tactical equipment footprint, and provide the unit with the necessary agility for mobile operations. Hybrid vehicle architectures and drivetrain-based power generation are enabling the ability for export power to become another source for tactical electrical power. With the developments in increasing the available onboard electrical power from the engine, while maintaining the same volume, higher voltage architectures and the use of Silicon Carbide (SiC) Wide Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, more power can be delivered without needing to increase space claims or vehicle level cooling [1]. Figure 1 shows how the developments in hybrid vehicles and drivetrain-based power generation have created a high voltage internal DC bus that allows for a 600VDC input inverter to be used to generate export power. Prior demonstrations have proven that drivetrain-based power generation system can deliver the same fuel efficiency in high power mode (30kW) or a 2-to-1 improvement in a low-power mode (less than 10kW) as compared to the equivalent Tactical Quiet Generators. [1] The next challenge is to deliver this same functionality in a package that can be integrated within the confines of the tactical and ground vehicle space constraints. Calnetix Technologies has developed a high-frequency, high-power-density, and bi-directional inverter. Figure 2 shows the Enercycle DC-1000™ inverter which can export electric power up to 500kW from the internal 600VDC bus in a >11 kW/L package.  While the Enercycle DC-1000 inverter is able to convert the high voltage DC bus to three-phase VAC power, it needs to be scalable for the lower end of tactical power requirements and have harmonic distortion removal functionality incorporated to prevent damage to downstream loads.

1. INTRODUCTION (Draft)
Electrification initiatives within the U.S. Army are rapidly advancing as a means of enhancing both combat capabilities and logistical efficiency. While the Army's earliest electrification efforts focus on non-tactical vehicles, the long-term vision includes hybrid or fully electric tactical wheeled and tracked platforms [1]-[3]. Electrification offers numerous benefits in the battlefield context—ranging from increased low-speed torque and silent-watch features to reductions in maintenance, noise, and fuel dependence. However, the electrification of combat vehicles creates additional design challenges, as tracked platforms in particular require power levels far exceeding those of commercial electric vehicles, spanning 100 kW to over 1 MW [4].
As part of the Platform Electrification and Mobility (PEM) project [4], Calnetix Technologies is contributing to the Army's modernization strategy by developing a high-frequency, high-power-density, and bi-directional inverter solution, the Enercycle™ DC-1000. This inverter targets the unique demands of tracked and other high-power vehicles, where dense packaging, ruggedness, and scalability are paramount. Importantly, the same onboard technology that enables propulsion and auxiliary systems also opens the door to robust export power—allowing a vehicle's engine-driven generator and internal DC bus to power external loads in forward operating or remote locations. Such capabilities have the potential to reduce the logistical burden of separate generators, decrease overall footprint, and support agile operations with mobile power [1].
This paper details the progress of the DC-1000 design and testing under the PEM project, highlighting its continuous output power of 500 kW, transient capability up to 640 kW, and compact volume of approximately 45 liters. The key technical contributions include a focus on power quality requirements, thermal performance under high-current operations, and integration strategies that support a wide range of military vehicle electrification architectures. Section 2 provides an overview of the DC-1000 itself, followed by a discussion of power quality specifications, experimental setup, and data analysis in Section 3. Section 4 presents hardware testing results and thermal analyses, while Section 5 addresses the design of the sine wave filter for improved output performance. Packaging considerations and lessons learned are described in Section 6, and Section 7 discusses next steps for field integration and technology maturation. The paper concludes in Section 8 with a summary of key findings and the implications for future Army electrification programs.
 
Option 1 (Focus on Strategic Impact & Challenges):**
 
> The U.S. Army's strategic shift towards electrification is rapidly transforming the landscape of both combat capabilities and logistical operations. While initial efforts have focused on non-tactical vehicles, the long-term vision necessitates the integration of hybrid and fully electric powertrains into tactical wheeled and, critically, tracked platforms. This transition promises significant battlefield advantages, including enhanced torque, silent operation, and reduced maintenance and fuel dependence. However, the high power demands of combat vehicles, particularly tracked platforms requiring power levels from 100 kW to over 1 MW, present formidable engineering challenges, demanding innovation in power electronics design. 
 
This paper details Calnetix Technologies' contribution to the Army's Platform Electrification and Mobility (PEM) project [4]: the development and testing of the Enercycle™ DC-1000.

The DC-1000's design prioritizes dense packaging, ruggedness, and scalability while also enabling robust export power capabilities, potentially reducing logistical burdens and supporting agile, mobile operations. We will discuss the key technical advancements of this project including achieving a continuous output power of 500 kW, a transient capability of 640 kW within approximately 45 liters. The core focus is to discuss design features concerning power quality under high current load, thermal performance, and system integration considerations for a range of military vehicle architectures. This paper proceeds with a detailed overview of the inverter (Section 2), followed by an exploration of power quality (Section 3) including experimental design and data analysis, hardware testing results and thermal analysis (Section 4), our sine wave filter design (Section 5), packaging and lessons learned (Section 6), our plan for field integration (Section 7), and concluding remarks (Section 8).
 
**Option 2 (Focus on Technology & Application):**
 
The U.S. Army has been aggressively pursuing vehicle electrification to enhance both combat performance and logistical efficiency. While initial efforts have focused on non-tactical vehicles, the long-term vision will require the integration of hybrid and fully electric powertrains into tactical wheeled and tracked platforms. This initiative demands the development of advanced power electronics capable of delivering a substantial amount of power needed for combat vehicles. This is especially common with tracked platforms with requirements spanning 100 kW to well over 1 MW. Electrification provides compelling benefits on the battlefield such as increased low-speed torque, silent operation, reduced maintenance, and decreased fuel dependence. However, the demanding operational parameters and high power requirements present a great number of technical challenges.

The core objective was to deliver a compact, high-power, bi-directional inverter capable of supporting advanced hybrid-electric propulsion and onboard power generation. This addresses the inherent constraints of military platforms - limited volume and weight allocations, stringent operational conditions, and demands for multi-mode, high-performance operation. Key challenges included achieving exceptional power density (kW/L), robust thermal management to operate reliably in harsh environments, and ensuring seamless bi-directional power flow between high-voltage DC and three-phase AC systems. These challenges were addressed through the adoption of advanced wide-bandgap semiconductor technology and sophisticated control algorithms.
 
**2.2 Key Specifications and Performance Metrics**
 
The DC-1000 is engineered to deliver 500 kW of continuous output with a transient capability of 640 kW, operating at a nominal 600 VDC bus voltage. Its compact design achieves a total volume of 45-50 liters, with integrated liquid cooling circuits capable of handling coolant temperatures up to 105°C. The use of silicon-carbide (SiC) MOSFETs enables high-frequency switching, enhancing efficiency and minimizing component size. Unlike traditional inverters, the DC-1000 is designed for oil-free operation, minimizing maintenance and simplifying integration. Table 1 summarizes key performance specifications, including efficiency, weight, and relevant operational parameters.
 
**2.3 System Architecture and Operational Modalities**
 
Figure 2 illustrates the DC-1000 system architecture. The inverter interfaces directly with the high-voltage DC bus, the traction motor/generator, and ancillary loads. It is capable of bi-directional operation - converting DC to AC (motoring mode) to drive electric motors and AC to DC (generating mode) to recharge batteries or provide power to the high-voltage bus. This bidirectional functionality is critical for both series-hybrid and parallel-hybrid propulsion architectures. The control architecture also includes provisions for export power functionality and parallel operation of multiple inverters for increased power output, enhancing mission flexibility.
 
**2.4 Integration, Modularity, and Interfacing**
 
The DC-1000 is designed with modularity and ease of integration in mind. It can be readily deployed in various hybrid and all-electric architectures, including series-hybrid, parallel-hybrid, and fully electric drivelines. Standardized, military-grade connectors (e.g., specified in MIL-STD-38999) facilitate rapid platform integration and replacement in the field. The inverter's control and communication systems conform to industry-standard protocols (CAN and potentially high-speed Ethernet) facilitating seamless integration with existing vehicle control networks.
 
**2.5 Thermal Management and Ruggedization**
 
The thermal design of the DC-1000 is critical to its reliability under demanding operational conditions. A high-efficiency liquid cooling loop, integrated with conduction paths, ensures robust thermal management and maintains device junction temperatures within specified limits. These cooling circuits are designed for compatibility with MIL-STD specified fluids and flow rates. The entire unit is ruggedized to withstand shock, vibration, and other environmental stressors defined in relevant military standards, ensuring consistent performance in the harshest conditions. A detailed thermal performance analysis is presented in Section 4.2, while the packaging approach is discussed further in Section 6.
 
 
 
**2.6 Control and Communication Architecture**
 
The DC-1000 employs a high-performance digital signal processor (DSP) based control system. This architecture implements sensorless control algorithms, fast switching techniques, and advanced harmonic filtering for optimal power quality and efficiency. The system also incorporates built-in diagnostics and fault detection, enabling rapid response and mitigation of potential issues. The DSP is also responsible for handling all control communications across the vehicle network via CAN and optionally Ethernet protocols.
 
**2.7 Role in Vehicle Electrification and Power Projection**
 
The DC-1000 is a critical enabler of vehicle electrification, contributing to improved fuel economy, extended operational range, and silent watch capability. The export power function facilitates forward operational deployments by supplying high-power AC to support temporary command posts, field hospitals, or equipment maintenance depots. The power quality, performance, and robustness of the DC-1000 will be evaluated in detail in the sections on Power Quality (Section 4.1) and Test Results (Section 5), demonstrating the efficacy of the system in meeting mission-critical requirements.

4.2 Thermal Analysis
4.2.1 Objectives and Scope
A key design objective for the DC-1000 inverter is to sustain continuous operation at power outputs up to 500 kW while maintaining safe junction temperatures of power modules and other critical components. This section outlines the methodology used to evaluate the inverter's thermal performance, focusing on liquid coolant flow, component-level temperature measurements, and transient thermal behavior.
4.2.2 Methodology
Test Configuration
The DC-1000 was mounted to a standardized test stand that simulates a vehicle-based cooling loop. Coolant inlet temperature was maintained at 85-105°C to replicate engine and environmental conditions commonly encountered in tracked vehicle platforms.
Thermocouples were installed on key locations: SiC MOSFET modules, DC bus capacitors, gate driver boards, and the outer enclosure.
Coolant Flow and Pressure
A variable-speed pump maintained the coolant flow rate between 25-35 L/min at a constant inlet pressure of 3.4 bar. Flow rates were recorded continuously to characterize any impact on component temperatures.
Thermal Instrumentation
T-type thermocouples measured the inverter enclosure surface temperature, internal air temperature, and coolant inlet/outlet temperatures.
An infrared (IR) camera was used during select tests to visualize potential hot spots on the power stage heatsinks and PCBs.
Operating Conditions
Low Load (100 kW): Preliminary shakedown and partial load condition for warm-up.
Nominal Load (500 kW): Core test to assess steady-state temperatures at design power.
Transient Load (up to 640 kW): Short bursts (30-90 seconds) to observe how quickly component temperatures rise and how effectively the cooling loop responds.
Data Acquisition and Reporting
A multi-channel DAQ system sampled temperature sensors at 1 Hz. Real-time monitoring software flagged any excursions beyond pre-set temperature thresholds (typically 120°C for power modules).
4.2.3 Results and Observations
Steady-State Temperatures
Under 500 kW continuous operation at 90°C coolant inlet, the average MOSFET junction temperature stabilized at ~105°C, remaining within the manufacturer's recommended limit of 125°C.
The DC link capacitor temperatures remained below 85°C, indicating sufficient airflow and thermal conduction paths to dissipate heat effectively.
Transient Behavior
During 640 kW transient load tests (30-second bursts), MOSFET temperatures spiked by 15-20°C within the first 10 seconds but quickly plateaued thanks to the high-flow coolant supply.
Thermal recovery to steady-state levels occurred within 2-3 minutes post-load.
Hot Spots and Uniformity
IR imaging revealed slight temperature gradients along the heatsink fins, with a maximum delta of 5°C between corners. This suggests the coolant channel design effectively distributes heat load, but minor improvements in fin geometry or coolant manifold design could further optimize temperature uniformity.
Impact of Coolant Flow Variations
Reducing flow to 25 L/min led to a 5-7°C increase in MOSFET junction temperatures at the same power output, indicating that maintaining adequate flow rate is critical for high-load missions.
4.2.4 Discussion
These findings confirm that the DC-1000 design can handle the thermal stresses associated with high-voltage, high-power-density operation under representative military ground vehicle conditions. The liquid-cooled heatsink and thermally conductive enclosure jointly manage heat dissipation even under transient loads approaching 640 kW. Although results indicate overall robustness, future iterations may focus on refining heatsink geometry to ensure maximum temperature uniformity and investigating the viability of reducing the required coolant flow rate for further efficiency gains.
4.2.5 Key Takeaways
The DC-1000 power stage operates safely within specified thermal limits under both nominal and transient power conditions.
Coolant temperature and flow rate are critical factors influencing peak device temperatures.
IR imaging facilitated the identification of potential hot spots, guiding future design tweaks.
 
 
3. POWER QUALITY
3.1 Requirements
A key design criterion for the DC-1000 inverter is compliance with military power quality and EMI/EMC standards, ensuring safe and reliable operation in harsh environments. In particular, the inverter must:
Limit Harmonic Distortion
Typically, voltage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) should remain below 5-8% for three-phase AC outputs, depending on load and standard (e.g., MIL-STD-1399, IEEE 519, or relevant Army guidance).
Maintain Voltage Regulation & Frequency Stability
Over the load range (0-100% rated load), the AC output must not deviate more than ±5% from nominal voltage and ±0.5 Hz from nominal frequency under steady-state conditions.
Protect Downstream Equipment
Sensitive military electronics and auxiliary systems require minimal ripple and transient spikes on the output side. This includes controlling inrush currents during start-up or sudden load changes.
 
3.2 Setup and Methodology
Test Bench Configuration
Inverter Output: The DC-1000 was configured to produce a nominal three-phase, 480 VAC output at 60 Hz.
Load Bank: A programmable resistive-inductive load bank simulated varying load profiles (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the inverter's rated power).
Power Analyzer: A multi-channel power quality analyzer (Chroma 6630 or equivalent) measured output voltage, current, THD, and frequency at a sampling rate of 25 kHz.
Harmonic & Distortion Measurement
Voltage/Current Waveforms: Captured at each load level for both line-to-line and line-to-neutral outputs.
Frequency & Phase Angle: Monitored to detect drifting or phase imbalances under dynamic load steps.
Test Phases
Steady-State Loads: Held for at least 5 minutes at each load level to capture stable harmonic profiles.
Transient Load Steps: Instantly switching from 25% → 75% → 100% load to evaluate transient response and overshoot/undershoot behavior.
No-Load & Light-Load Conditions: Included to test how the inverter manages minimal demands without excessive switching noise or distortion.
 
3.3 Data Analysis and Reporting
Voltage THD
Steady-State: Across the entire load spectrum (0-100%), the line-to-line voltage THD remained below 3.5%. The highest distortion typically occurred at 25% load, attributed to partial conduction intervals and less smoothing from the filter stage.
Transient: During rapid load changes, voltage THD briefly spiked by 1-2% above steady-state values but recovered within 200 ms.
Current THD
High Loads: At or near full load (90-100%), current THD stabilized between 4-5%, reflecting efficient switching and a well-tuned sine wave filter (see Section 5).
Low Loads: Light-load conditions saw slightly higher current THD (up to 7%), still within acceptable military power guidelines for non-critical system states.
Voltage Regulation & Frequency Stability
Voltage Deviation: Did not exceed ±3.5% of nominal, even at high load ramps. This meets typical Army tactical generator specs (±5%).
Frequency Drift: Stayed within ±0.1 Hz at steady loads and ±0.3 Hz during transients, well below the ±0.5 Hz target.
Transient Response
Load Step from 25% to 100%: Output voltage momentarily dipped by 6-8%, returning to within ±2% of nominal in under 150 ms.
No Inrush Current Issues: Start-up tests showed no excessive current spikes, indicating the inverter's soft-start features effectively mitigate surges.
Compliance with Military Standards
Harmonics: Met guidelines outlined in MIL-STD-1399 (Section 300) and typical Army power quality envelopes.
EMI/EMC: Although not specifically documented in this section, preliminary EMC scans suggested conformance with MIL-STD-461 limits for conducted and radiated emissions.

112 kW with DC Load (Example Subsection)
In a separate experiment, the DC-1000 was tested with a 112 kW DC load connected through a DC port. This test evaluated the inverter's capability to manage voltage and current harmonics on the AC output while simultaneously supplying DC loads. Results indicated minimal crosstalk or distortion on the AC side, underscoring the inverter's robust control algorithms and filter design.
Key Observation: Even with a significant DC draw, AC output THD remained under 4%, showcasing the system's ability to handle multiple power conversion paths efficiently.
 
Overall Findings
These results confirm that the DC-1000 inverter delivers clean, stable power suitable for military-grade applications, with low harmonic distortion and rapid recovery from transient events. By meeting or exceeding standard Army specifications, the DC-1000 positions itself as a viable solution for vehicle-mounted export power and auxiliary systems on hybrid-electric combat platforms. Continued refinements—like improved filter designs (Section 5)—will further enhance harmonic performance and reduce thermal stress, ensuring reliable operation under a variety of mission-critical conditions.
 
 
7. CHALLENGES AND NEXT STEPS
7.1 Key Challenges
Thermal Management Under High Transient Loads
While the DC-1000 maintains acceptable junction temperatures at continuous power, short-duration transients approaching 640 kW can cause localized hot spots in the SiC power modules. The current cooling design manages these thermal spikes, but tighter temperature margins may necessitate optimized coolant flow paths or fin geometries for highly dynamic load profiles.
Integration with Legacy Vehicle Systems
Many military ground vehicles still rely on lower-voltage power architectures (e.g., 28V, 48V). Ensuring full compatibility with existing wiring, control interfaces, and form factors poses both mechanical and electrical integration challenges. Transitioning these fleets to higher-voltage (e.g., 600V) systems requires extensive training, safety protocols, and possibly additional DC-DC converters.
Minimizing Harmonic Distortion
Harmonic performance was within acceptable limits for most load conditions, but light-load scenarios occasionally produced slightly elevated total harmonic distortion (THD). This can affect sensitive downstream equipment, suggesting that further refinement of the inverter's filter design or switching strategy is beneficial to reduce partial-load distortion.
Ruggedization & Environmental Testing
Although initial mechanical and vibration tests indicate robust performance, extreme environmental testing (e.g., -40°C cold starts, salt-fog, sand/dust) is still in progress. These tests are essential to verify survivability in harsh operating conditions typical of deployed land platforms.
Supply Chain Constraints
The use of high-performance SiC MOSFETs is integral to achieving the DC-1000's power density goals. However, limited supplier availability and long lead times for wide-bandgap semiconductors can influence production scalability and program schedules.
 
7.2 Next Steps
Extended Field Trials
Following bench-level validation, we plan to integrate the DC-1000 into a prototype hybrid combat vehicle for in-theater simulations. This will involve testing under sustained vibration, shock loads, and temperature cycles. Data will guide incremental design improvements for thermal and EMI robustness.
Filter Optimization
A revised sine wave output filter is under development to further reduce partial-load THD and voltage ripple. This includes exploring active harmonic cancellation techniques and using lighter filter materials to maintain or reduce overall system weight.
Parallel Operation & Scalability
Upcoming studies will examine the parallel connection of multiple DC-1000 units. This effort aims to validate load sharing, synchronization, and redundancy strategies that enable total power outputs beyond 640 kW for next-generation armored platforms or export power applications.
Vehicle-Specific Packaging
Collaboration with prime defense integrators will refine mechanical packaging to meet custom envelope constraints. Options include modular enclosures, flexible connector orientations, and integrated cooling channels tailored to specific vehicle platforms.
Control Software Enhancements
Planned software updates will incorporate adaptive control algorithms to manage various mission profiles (e.g., silent watch vs. high-mobility). This includes more advanced self-diagnostic and self-protection features for real-time fault detection and mitigation.
Cybersecurity & System-Level Integration
As vehicles become increasingly networked, the inverter's digital signal processor (DSP) and communication interfaces must guard against cyber threats. Future firmware releases will implement encrypted communication and secure boot sequences to protect against tampering.
8. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented the development, testing, and integration considerations of the DC-1000 inverter as part of the U.S. Army's Platform Electrification and Mobility (PEM) project. The DC-1000 was designed to meet the high-power, high-frequency demands of military ground vehicles, offering a continuous output power of up to 500 kW and transient capability up to 640 kW within a compact, 45-liter enclosure.
Key findings indicate that:
High Efficiency and Power Quality
The DC-1000's SiC MOSFET-based switching stage and advanced digital control algorithms enable low harmonic distortion (<5% THD at nominal loads) and robust voltage regulation. Even during rapid load transients, voltage and frequency remained within military power quality requirements.
Thermal Performance
Rigorous heat-run and transient tests confirmed that the inverter maintains safe junction temperatures under continuous and short-duration surge conditions. Integrated liquid cooling effectively stabilizes operating temperatures, critical for sustained, high-power missions.
Scalability and Export Power
The bi-directional design supports both motoring and generating modes, facilitating various hybrid vehicle architectures. Additionally, the inverter's capabilities open avenues for export power applications, reducing reliance on standalone generators in forward deployments.
Vehicle Integration Challenges
Adapting to legacy power systems (e.g., 28V or 48V) and managing packaging constraints in tracked and wheeled platforms remain significant hurdles. However, modular design and parallelization strategies show promise for mitigating these challenges and enabling future vehicle upgrades.
Moving forward, the research team will focus on:
Refining Sine Wave Filtering to further minimize harmonic distortion at lighter loads.
Parallel Operation Studies to evaluate load sharing and redundancy across multiple inverters in high-power platforms.
Long-Duration Field Trials in operationally relevant environments (extreme temperatures, shock, vibration) to validate reliability and performance.
Cybersecurity Enhancements to ensure the inverter's control system remains robust against emerging digital threats.
Overall, these results position the DC-1000 as a viable power electronics solution for the Army's electrification roadmap. Its high-power density, thermal resilience, and export power capability make it an integral building block for future hybrid and electric military vehicle fleets, offering cost-effective and operationally advantageous improvements over traditional drivetrain power systems.
Conclusion
In summary, our testing of the DC-1000 has yielded valuable insights into both its thermal and electrical performance under demanding conditions. The thermal analysis confirmed that the unit's critical components are operating within safe margins, closely aligning with our simulation models. Meanwhile, the electrical evaluation demonstrated robust current handling and stable voltage regulation; however, challenges such as voltage overshoot and leakage current—particularly during low-side double pulse tests—remain areas of focus. The introduction of snubber capacitors has shown promise in mitigating voltage overshoot, though further optimization of gate driver settings and busbar design is necessary. These findings not only validate key aspects of the DC-1000's design but also provide clear direction for future refinements to ensure the system meets all operational requirements.
 
Challenges
Our evaluation has revealed several key challenges that need to be addressed to fully optimize the DC-1000's performance. Voltage overshoot remains a significant concern, particularly during low-side double pulse tests, where leakage currents increase with bus voltage, leading to an estimated 10kW power loss at 600VDC with 16A leakage. The overshoot behavior is inconsistent, as it does not scale proportionally with the current, which suggests possible issues with busbar impedance and the measurement approach. Additionally, the system may be affected by suboptimal gate driver settings—specifically, a gate voltage output of +15V/-10V rather than the recommended +15V/-15V—as well as potential defects in the Mitsubishi SiC modules. These factors, along with the observed inconsistency in leg current di/dt for parallel SiC modules, underscore the need for further detailed investigation and refinement.
Next Steps
Moving forward, our focus will be on optimizing both the electrical design and firmware configuration to mitigate these issues. We plan to continue iterative testing while tuning the firmware with EDU1 to fine-tune gate driver performance and minimize voltage overshoot. A redesign of the busbar is under consideration—specifically, reorienting the bus capacitor by 180° toward the inverter modules—to reduce inductance and improve current distribution. Additionally, further diagnostic tests will be conducted to accurately measure the SiC module leg currents and to validate any modifications. By addressing these challenges systematically, we aim to ensure the DC-1000 meets its full current and power requirements reliably in all operating conditions.

More insight into what programs are of focus on which team.
 
M88 Platform
XM30 Digital Engineering program
 
 
DRS Export Power Application - I've contacted DRS for a update on this however still awaiting feedback
 
SBIR 60kW  - We were selected to be awarded and it has been publicly announced. As of now next steps are to begin contract negotiations. That should happen in the next few weeks.
 
DCS IEPC - We responded to a RFI and provided a technical response to the inverter requirements they provided. I received word this last month that is program is on hold by their customer. 
 
The SBIR proposal for a lighter low-cost family of inverters - this opportunity was lost and we were not selected for further consideration. However, we did receive some positive feedback. In summary are technical approach and potential for army impact was both highly rated. But an area we fell short in is demonstrating our plan to obtain funding outside the DoD 
 
DRS DC-1000s for Sentinel A4 Platform - This is a radar system development by Lockheed Martin. It seems as so the Army is interested in using On-board Vehicle power to power these systems. They're requesting 10 units of the DC-1000 and Sine Wave Filter with an estimated delivery date in 2027

Snubber capacitors reduce voltage and current spikes ultimately minimizing losses from the switching devices (SiC MOSFETS?) We didn't use one when were 
Cheaper and faster option for automotive snubber caps
We can meet and run power quality testing by 2/19 date even if it's just the 112kW with DC-load - Bonnie
Firmware is behind schedule. I spoke to Zhong he's back there doing the tests necessary to modify and develop the firmware.
Who's doing the tests Bonnie, Zhong, Karen, Arash
When are they starting? Now. Next step is complete cold start (zero load bank) testing after the weekend we'll have higher power available for actual power tests starting with 112kW
What is Arash's role in the testing? Playing Mr. Professor and not understanding shortcuts must be made.
 
 
Thermal Analysis that has already been done.
Any pieces on packaging 
No formal changes to packaging design
Snubber caps are a new component in the system so packaging change.

Feedback on SBIR
 
My latest tasks:
Iris wants to figure out how she can divi up the work between us. Her thought process is to do it by product base. 
I need to write a paper for GVSETS next conference. Suggestion is to write it on Export Power
DCS has asked us to co-author a paper on the DC-1000 we built for them 
Iris wants me to write the portion that covers SiC HESC drive for the section Advanced Prototyping MIL-STD compliant Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) at scale (and associated components, like EMI filters etc.).
 
 
Who do we really plan on selling to because the army isn't going to be our direct customer. Our direct customer is likely to be an OEM.
Not enough bandwidth on current DSP board to be able to reuse. We need a redesign to last us the next 5-10 years.
We need a power electronics team the goal is to sell the CEO on making the investment to build this team.
Hope to finish power quality by February to write a paper for GVSETS if not we would write paper on DC-1000
Did you review convention list?
My thoughts on SBIR
Understanding main objective with SBIR and that it is my sole responsibility.
What are your expectations on proposals? Is your expectation to offload it completely or work as a team  to complete it?

His involvement started after the initial design of the DC 1000. He did the cold plates and more.
 
Changes he would make is move the capacitors closer to the inputs or rotated 180 degrees. The current design causes a higher inductance. Plus there is a roundabout connection that leads around the capacitors that could be avoided. Hasn't been through a vibration test only analysis. 
 
Used 3D printed pieces (structural reasons) because of budget.

Capacity Sharing 
Defined as a situation where the load is 60kW and we have 2 Inverters in parallel supporting that load. Each inverter is providing 30kW to equate to a 60kW power supply.
 
Redundancy Sharing
Defined as a situation where the load is only 30kW and there are two inverters in parallel ready to support the load. If one fails then the other will immediately take its place. However, there's a potential situation where one shorts and with no fault isolation system onboard the other inverter

Calnetix Technologies' Permanent Magnet (PM) Motor Generators have been developed using advanced engineering methods and materials ranging from a few watts to megawatt power levels with speeds from 10,000 rpm to 120,000 rpm and beyond. The company offers Magnaforce™ motor generators for low voltage applications (< 1 MW), such as blood pumps, turbochargers, industrial spray dryers, precision lasers and chillers, and Ultraforce™ motor generators for low and medium voltage applications, such as air separation, gas turbines and flywheel-based energy storage at all power levels. These power-dense rotor-stator sets provide full torque and exceptionally high efficiency through the operating speed range. The rotors may use a metallic or composite sleeve designed to fit the application, sometimes including corrosive and harsh internal fluids in hermetic designs.
 
Calnetix Technologies specializes in high-speed rotating machinery supported by patented Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which help optimize system efficiency and enhance reliability and sustainability. The company offers PM biased Powerflux™ Magnetic Bearings and electro-magnetic biased Xcelflux™ Magnetic Bearings. Calnetix team has developed bearings with radial load capacity ranging from 25 lbf to over 5,000 lbf and axial load capacity ranging from 100 lbf to over 10,000 lbf. Both types of bearings have been utilized in a wide variety of commercial and industrial systems, including blowers, compressors, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems, turboexpanders, flywheels and many more. Calnetix's AMBs present unique advantages over conventional roller or fluid-film bearings. Unlike conventional bearings, AMBs suspend the target rotor in a magnetic field. The result is a non-contact oil-free rotor support system with extremely low friction and no contact wear. The AMBs enable hermetically sealed turbomachinery designs with no rotating seals to the outside environment, leading to low risk of hazardous leakages and fluid losses.

Tactical Quiet Generators and Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS)
 
TQGs have a published reliability of 500-600 hours.
 
AMMPS delivered a 10% reduction in size and weight from TQGs and be 750 hours of reliability [1]
 
Existing Army generator solutions require various tactical vehicles to transport them to their point of use. The use of onboard generated power can reduce the logistics of delivering power. [2]
<<DRS_OpReadiness_Gatherer_Jim_27June19.pdf>> 
 
<<DoD SBIR 24.4 Annual BAA Preface_09252024.pdf>> 
In traditional Army setups, external generators like the Tactical Quiet Generators (TQGs) and Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) are transported by various tactical vehicles to deliver power to their point of use. This arrangement often requires a significant amount of logistical support to transport, deploy, and maintain these generators, including extra vehicles and personnel.
 
Onboard power generation—where vehicles generate their own power through integrated systems such as drivetrain-based power systems—can significantly reduce these logistical needs. By generating power directly from the vehicle's engine or drivetrain, these systems eliminate the need for separate generator units, reducing the number of vehicles and personnel required for power transport and setup. This integrated approach enables faster deployment and improved mobility, as power is immediately available wherever the vehicle is located, thus enhancing operational flexibility and reducing dependence on convoy support for energy needs​.

Weight of AMMPS
https://incal.cummins.com/www/literature/brochures/F-2254-MilitaryAdvancedMediumMobilePowerSources-en.pdf
 
The Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) have been recognized for providing the military with significant advantages, including improved energy efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, enhanced mobility, and better integration with modern power systems. These generators offer quieter operation, lower maintenance requirements, and increased reliability compared to previous models.
Using the logic and benefits associated with AMMPS, here are five bullet points describing the benefits of a lightweight bidirectional inverter using onboard power for export power:
Enhanced Mobility and Operational Flexibility
Elimination of Separate Generators: By utilizing onboard vehicle power through a lightweight bidirectional inverter, military units can remove the need for separate generators. This reduction in equipment decreases the logistical burden and increases the mobility of units in the field.
Rapid Deployment: Vehicles equipped with such inverters can provide immediate power support wherever they are, enhancing responsiveness in dynamic operational environments.
Improved Energy Efficiency and Reduced Fuel Consumption
Consolidated Fuel Use: Drawing power directly from the vehicle's existing fuel supply reduces overall fuel consumption compared to operating both a vehicle and separate generators.

Simplified Logistics and Maintenance
Streamlined Supply Chains: Fewer pieces of equipment simplify logistics from procurement to deployment and resupply, allowing for more efficient operations.
Unified Maintenance Schedules: Maintenance can be conducted simultaneously for the vehicle and the inverter system, reducing downtime and resource allocation.
Reduced Training Requirements: Personnel need training on a single integrated system rather than multiple pieces of equipment, enhancing efficiency and proficiency.
Enhanced Operational Security
Lower Acoustic Signatures: Onboard inverters typically operate more quietly than standalone generators, aiding in stealth operations by reducing noise that could reveal unit positions.
Reduced Thermal Signatures: Efficient inverter systems produce less heat compared to conventional generators, making vehicles less detectable by infrared sensors.
Minimized Exposure: Eliminating the need to deploy and refuel external generators reduces the risk to personnel in hostile environments.
Interoperability and Scalability with Modern Power Systems
Integration with Tactical Microgrids: Bidirectional inverters enable vehicles to seamlessly connect with tactical microgrids, enhancing energy sharing and management across units.
Support for Future Technologies: The inverters can interface with renewable energy sources and energy storage systems, providing a pathway for adopting emerging technologies and improving sustainability.
Scalable Power Solutions: The modularity allows for adjusting power output to meet varying mission demands, from powering individual devices to entire command posts.
 
 
At the scale of a single Army end-user, argue that their jobs or lives will be significantly improved if your solution is adopted. What is the impact of your solution for a soldier/Army civilian vs. today's solutions?
Here, we're looking for an idea of how broad the impact you described above could be. Look into the future to a time when your solution is both technically mature and actively in use by Army personnel. Describe the scale and scope of your impact within the context of the Army.
 
**Operational Impact**
 
1. **Increased Mobility and Reduced Physical Burden for Soldiers**
 
Elimination of Heavy Generators: Our lightweight bidirectional inverter allows soldiers to utilize onboard vehicle power for export power, removing the need to transport and set up heavy Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) generators, which can weigh several hundred pounds.
Enhanced Tactical Flexibility: By reducing the equipment load, individual soldiers experience less physical strain, leading to improved mobility and quicker maneuverability on the battlefield.
Rapid Power Availability: Soldiers can access power immediately from their vehicles without the delays associated with generator deployment, enhancing operational readiness and response times.
Reduced Fuel Consumption: Utilizing the vehicle's existing fuel supply for power generation leads to overall fuel savings compared to operating both a vehicle and separate generators.
Enhanced Safety: Fewer resupply missions and less handling of external equipment decrease the exposure of soldiers to potential threats during convoys or while setting up generators in unsecured areas.
 
**Potential Scale of Impact**
 
1. **Army-Wide Efficiency and Resource Optimization**
 
Significant Logistical Advantages:* Widespread adoption of our inverter technology across the Army could lead to substantial reductions in fuel usage, maintenance costs, and the manpower required for generator operation and upkeep.
Standardization and Interoperability:* As the technology becomes standard across various vehicle platforms, it simplifies training and maintenance protocols, leading to a more efficient force.
Support for Future Technologies:* The inverter's compatibility with the Army's 600V vehicle electrification plans positions it as a critical component in the modernization of the fleet, enabling integration with advanced systems and renewable energy sources.
Extended Operational Reach:* With more efficient and readily available power, units can operate longer and more sustainably in remote or austere environments without relying on extensive supply lines.
Increased Mission Success Rates:* Improved energy resilience and reduced logistical burdens contribute to higher readiness levels and the ability to respond more effectively to dynamic operational demands.
Force Multiplication:* The ability to power a wide range of equipment directly from vehicles enhances the overall capabilities of the Army, from supporting high-tech communication systems to operating energy-intensive defense mechanisms, thereby strengthening national defense posture.
 
Utilizing our solution for export power through onboard vehicle power eliminates the need to transport and set up heavy AMMPS generators. Providing the same output power as a 30kW AMMPS at less than 2% of the weight [1]

Below are several examples of On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) solutions, including both government and industry-led programs. These systems transform military vehicles (or commercial platforms) into mobile power sources, providing exportable electrical power for a variety of applications—from operating command-and-control equipment to recharging batteries and supporting medical units in the field.
 
1. Leonardo DRS - TITAN OBVP
        •        Key Features:
        •        Provides up to 125 kW of export power directly from the vehicle's drivetrain.
        •        Integrates a high-power alternator and advanced power electronics.
        •        Designed primarily for tactical wheeled vehicles (e.g., HMMWVs, FMTVs).
        •        Applications:
        •        Running command posts, communications gear, and electronic warfare systems.
        •        Eliminating the need for separate, towed generator sets in forward deployments.
 
2. BAE Systems On-Board Vehicle Power Solutions
        •        Key Features:
        •        Upgraded transmission and power electronics to deliver consistent AC power for military trucks and combat vehicles.
        •        Can be configured for various power levels depending on the host vehicle size and engine capacity.
        •        Applications:
        •        Powering radar systems, advanced sensors, and other mission-critical systems without relying on external generators.
        •        Supporting silent watch operations by pairing with battery storage for reduced acoustic and thermal signatures.
 
3. Oshkosh Vehicle Power Integration
        •        Key Features:
        •        Oshkosh's tactical vehicles can be outfitted with higher-capacity alternators and inverters, producing enough electricity to operate command centers, communication hubs, or medical stations.
        •        Emphasis on rugged design and simplified operator interface.
        •        Applications:
        •        Forward operating bases where rapid setup of power infrastructure is required.
        •        Situations where mobility and survivability are as important as power generation (e.g., route clearance missions).
 
4. Vanner On-Board Power Solutions
        •        Key Features:
        •        Vanner specializes in DC-to-AC power inverters and battery management systems that can integrate with military vehicles.
        •        Designed to be lightweight and compact for easy vehicle integration.
        •        Applications:
        •        Powering auxiliary equipment (laptops, radios, small appliances) in light tactical vehicles.
        •        Often used in emergency response vehicles and specialized transport trucks.
 
5. Army Vehicle-Mounted Electric Power (VMEP) Initiatives
        •        Key Features:
        •        Various developmental programs under the U.S. Army and Marine Corps that integrate high-output alternators and inverters directly into combat vehicle drivetrains.
        •        May support both “on-the-move” power generation and stationary, exportable power modes.
        •        Applications:
        •        Battlefield sustainment (charging batteries for drones, powering laser systems).
        •        Supplementing or replacing traditional generator sets in distributed operations.
 
Typical Benefits of OBVP
        1.        Reduced Logistics Footprint:
        •        Eliminates or reduces the need to tow or carry separate generator trailers.
        •        Frees up convoy space and simplifies supply lines (less fuel, fewer spare parts).
        2.        Enhanced Mission Flexibility:
        •        Enables troops to set up power in remote areas without waiting for dedicated generator units.
        •        Allows fast relocation of power sources along with the vehicle.
        3.        Improved Efficiency & Fuel Savings:
        •        Single engine powering both vehicle mobility and electricity generation can be more fuel-efficient than separate generators.
        •        Integrated systems can take advantage of idle engine power during normal vehicle operations.
        4.        Silent Watch & Hybrid Applications:
        •        When paired with batteries, OBVP can support silent watch operations (engine off) while still delivering electricity.
        •        Reduces acoustic and thermal signatures, critical for stealth in forward operations.
 
In Summary: OBVP solutions—like Leonardo DRS's TITAN system, BAE Systems on-board power modules, or Oshkosh integrated alternator-inverter setups—are becoming increasingly popular for militaries looking to minimize logistics burdens and maximize power availability in the field. By leveraging the vehicle's drivetrain (or in some cases, hybrid-electric systems), OBVP can provide a reliable, mobile power source without the need for dedicated generator sets.
